  settlement_levies:0 "Settlement Levies"
  settlement_levies_desc:0 "As far back as the rebuilding of civilization, a system of decentralized and localized levying of troops contained to individual settlements have served us well in every conflict until now. While not effective on a strategical scale, the recruitment of officers and building of regional training bases let us leave soldiers relatively close to home, boosting moral as well as civilian manpower."
  volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Wasteland Militias"
  volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "With the constantly emerging threat of the wasteland and neighbouring nations, it would do us well to reform our army into something more strategically sound. Organizing levies into regional militias let us improve our command effectiveness without pulling them from their homes, and increased funding allocated to training and recruitment increases our forces."
  funded_militia_conscription:0 "Funded Militias"
  funded_militia_conscription_desc:0 "Investing even more into our organization is a sound decision, considering the state of the wasteland. Pulling funds toward the construction of military bases let us concentrate our forces even more, as well as providing a reinforced structure within which our soldiers can train more freely with their new "toys" that our taxpayers gracefully helped acquire."
  two_year_conscription:0 "Two Year Conscription"
  two_year_conscription_desc:0 "Forcing a conscription onto our population might make a lot of people very unhappy, but it is sadly a decision we will have to take to prepare properly. To minimize the effects of conscription, a two year rotation will be put into law, which should provide our conscripts with some breathing room and a light at the end of the tunnel."
  four_year_conscription:0 "Four Year Conscription"
  four_year_conscription_desc:0 "Extending the conscription to a four year rotation will considerably increase our available manpower, but with it comes consequences. Massive funding has to be allocated to train conscripts to a decent standard for our army, and moral is slowly degrading even if our citizens understand our situation. We must be careful if we are to go further."
  until_dismissal_conscription:0 "Service Until Dismissal"
  until_dismissal_conscription_desc:0 "As of now, our government has officially declared a state of emergency. Every conscription centre is to pull overtime, and conscripts will only be dismissed when we deem them no longer useful, or the emergency passes. With moral now plummeting as civilians are even pulled from the factories and their homes, we must remember we are doing this to preserve our way of life."
  child_conscription:0 "War Never Changes"
  child_conscription_desc:0 "Civilians ripped from their homes, fathers, mothers; sons, daughters. But what choice do we have against the apocalypse? Are we to leave ourselves perish, are we not to rage against our fate until the bitter end? Already, the forced conscriptions and training leave kind-hearted people into empty shells. Our nation might never forgive us. Our citizens will hate us, our officers will resent us, and our culture might never recover fully. But it is all worth it if only to leave a hateful nation standing. Damned be the wasteland for leaving us no choice, and damned be our souls for going down this path. War truly never changes."
  # conscription laws Caesar's Legion
  tribal_recruitment:0 "Tribal Hastati"
  tribal_recruitment_desc:0 "Recruiting exclusively from our subjugated tribes offer many benefits to The Legion. Tribals are notorious for their warrior spirit and courageous soldiers, which will increase our effectiveness in battle. Recruiting only from tribals will also mean that our army is commanded by their own, as warchiefs and other high-ranks will command the rank and file."
  incorporate_mercenaries:0 "Hired Cohorts"
  incorporate_mercenaries_desc:0 "In addition our tribal forces, we can pay for and integrate a large amount of mercenaries in high-ranking officer positions and rank and files with only minimal impact on our army structure, improving our manpower pool without diminishing the warrior spirit of our forces to an extensive degree."
  settler_volunteers:0 "Recruited Auxiliary"
  settler_volunteers_desc:0 "Engaging in a widespread recruitment campaign targeting the settlers in our land will bring in considerable amount of wide-eyed recruit, willing to either die for or get paid by us. Such a huge number of non-tribal recruits in addition to mercenary forces is sure to diminish the organization of our army, as well as breeding discontent in the still mostly tribal rank and file."
  conscript_settlers:0 "Conscripted Principes"
  conscript_settlers_desc:0 "As the Bull rises, we require more and more men to fuel our conquests. Conscripting settlers to our cause in addition to our other efforts will provide us with just the right amount of soldiers to continue our conquests, but it is sure to deeply shake the structure of our army. Conscripts make for poor soldiers, and they require more training than volunteer. A conscription order is also sure to turn some of the people against us."
  conscript_children_of_caesar:0 "Nova Triarii"
  conscript_children_of_caesar_desc:0 "The obliteration of culture is one of the Legion's strongest tools at its behest. Settlers, traders, mercenaries and raiders - they all are moulded into the model of the Legion just as the Romans did to Gaul. We will remake the wasteland into our very image - and with it? We will have a army of loyal soldiers willing to die for our cause."
  # conscription laws Mexican Nations
  tlaloc_stagnation:0 "Tlaloc's Stagnation"
  tlaloc_stagnation_desc:0 "With the mighty Tlaloc having protected most of Mexico for decades, few of the Mexican nations possess a standing military, or even a federal militia. As such, resources can easily be diverted to internal matters, and a peaceful atmosphere has set in as the people feels safe under His guidance. This cannot last eternally, however."
  frontier_militias:0 "Frontier Militias"
  frontier_militias_desc:0 "Organizing willing citizen militias into nationalized armed forces will considerably increase our military capabilities, while still maintaining the peace, and diverting minimal resources to their training and armament. While it is a temporary solution, it can still buy us the time we need to properly arm our forces."
  adelitas_militias:0 "Adelitas Militias"
  adelitas_militias_desc:0 "As the need for more soldier becomes apparent, we can put in place a simple yet effective solution. Allowing willing women volunteer into our armies is sure to swell our rank, and provide us with countless capable soldiers. Putting this measure in place, however, might unnerve some of our population, as they see increasing militarization, and might break the feeling of peace that has permeated Mexico for so long."
  standing_garrisons:0 "National Garrisons"
  standing_garrisons_desc:0 "Reforming our army into a true mobile force, capable of efficient strategical movement, is an arduous task. Once done however, the militarization of our society will finally be finished, which will both increase our internal support in case of war, as well as bring a lot more recruits to our cause. Sadly, the population is now keenly aware of the fact that the flames of war are raging inside of Mexico, and will be more and more nervous as time goes on."
  mexican_conscription:0 "Gloria Mexicana"
  mexican_conscription_desc:0 "Putting in place a huge conscription program into every sector, from the fields to the factories, will bring countless soldiers to our cause, and will let any of our enemy experience the full wrath of the people of Mexico. But, in exchange, such a move is deeply unpopular, and will also take away vital manpower from some of our factories."
  # conscription laws Brotherhood
  paladins:0 "Paladins"
  paladins_desc:0 "The wasteland is an extremely harsh place. Not only will our external forces have to face raiders and mutants but also pockets of radiation, little to no food or water, and constant risk of debris in urban zones. As such, we will decide to only deploy the best of the best in this harsh place. Only the famous paladins, the highest rank our soldiers can achieve will be deployed. They shall be the brotherhood's sword, as well as its shield."
  senior_knights:0 "Senior Knights"
  senior_knights_desc:0 "As the need to project our power throughout the wasteland makes itself know, we have to compromise more and more. One cannot efficiently control vast pockets with soldiers requiring years of experience before they are deployed. Allowing senior knights, distinguished soldiers barely a rank below paladins, to deploy with them as support will bolster our troops, and still only allow the best into the wasteland."
  knights:0 "Knights"
  knights_desc:0 "With senior knights still taking a vast amount of training to deploy, and them being few in numbers in our already small manpower pool, we should consider allowing proven knights to deploy alongside higher ranks. Knights are still battle-proven soldiers, having earned not only their rank but the best weapon we can give them. Deploying them will come to the detriment of the effectiveness of our forces, but doing so will let us have many more units ready to defend the Brotherhood."
  scribes:0 "Scribes"
  scribes_desc:0 "The need for troops is overwhelming. We cannot sustain our military occupation and campaigns with only proven soldiers coming from our bunkers. Scribes are competent technicians eager to help our cause, and we can deploy them as rank and file soldiers, protected by knights and paladins. But this will mean they will not be safe in the bunker, studying technology. Deploying our scientist on the battlefield is also sure to make some of our citizens lose faith in our cause."
  initiates:0 "Initiates"
  initiates_desc:0 "Initiates are a numerous group of recruits that still need a lot of training before becoming knights. In case of extreme danger, we can decide to deploy them before they achieve that rank. Doing so means we can get troops necessitating little in terms of training, and would considerably increase the size of our army. But it will also mean sending untrained recruits in the wasteland, which is sure to turn away a number of citizens from our cause. Care is to be taken, as this decision is not done lightly."
  # conscription laws Raiders
  petty_gang_conscription:0 "Petty Gang Conscription"
  petty_gang_conscription_desc:0 "Many mock our current raiders as nothing more than a nuisance. But we can bully other gangs into joining us."
  raider_bands:0 "Raider Bands"
  raider_bands_desc:0 "Now that we have gathered a lot more strength, and more importantly a lot more guns, we can just begin firing willy nilly. While that might waste ammunition and make some fools lose sleep, it's almost certain to attract raider bands wanting to join on the fun. And for any that don't want to, we just need to point said weaponry at them instead."
  scum_and_villainy:0 "Scum And Villainy"
  scum_and_villainy_desc:0 "While we can't ever hope to intimidate the most ferocious warbands, we can certainly promise them a whole barrel of fun, as well as a few hundred barrels of actual explosives. With them they bring not only years of experience gained by riling raiders up, but they also more manpower than we could know what to do with."
  threat_to_all_people:0 "Threat To All People"
  threat_to_all_people_desc:0 "Why stop at our gang for recruitment? That's some petty stuff. Let's go even higher! We'll organize dozens... nah, hundreds of raiding parties into neighbouring territories. Blow everything up to kingdom come, make a huge ruckus, leave some calling cards between the burning bodies and the jet pit. That's sure to bring in new blood!"
  doom_of_wasteland:0 "Doom Of The Wasteland"
  doom_of_wasteland_desc:0 "With the huge reputation we now have, we are feared by all that knows of us. Some more efforts into a uh... "publicity campaign", we could even manage to have actual soldiers join us. The wasteland has no shortage of disgruntled grunts and officers that would love nothing more than to take it easy with the raider life, it's time to use that to our advantage."
  # conscription laws Tribals
  born_warriors:0 "Born Warriors"
  born_warriors_desc:0 "As per our tribe's tradition, we must assure only our warrior class ever set foot outside of our villages. The wasteland is a cruel place, full of horrible creatures and savages. We must take extreme precaution in deploying our people, and so only warriors trained from birth may earn the honour of waging war for the tribe."
  veteran_pathfinders:0 "Veteran Pathfinders"
  veteran_pathfinders_desc:0 "While it may be a mistake to break ancient tradition, we should consider increasing our fielded manpower. The tribe requires more of their own to defend itself, as such we shall consider deploying our most veteran pathfinders and hunters along with our warrior class, supporting them in their noble fight against the cruel wasteland."
  able_bodied_tribesmen:0 "Able Bodied Tribesmen"
  able_bodied_tribesmen_desc:0 "The outside world batters and wear down our tribe constantly, dangers besetting us from all side. We might not be able to survive without drastic measures, as such, we shall now deploy every able-bodied tribesmen. Courageous, trained, and following our tribe's most difficult warrior ritual, they are hardy fighters, ready to defend our land."
  first_sons_and_daughters:0 "First Sons And Daughters"
  first_sons_and_daughters_desc:0 "Shamed and humbled by our enemies, we must seek refuge into the inner strength of our tribe. While it is deeply unsettling to resort to such measures, we must now force a general conscription on every first son and daughter of fighting age of every tribe member. It is a harsh decision not taken lightly, and we shall make sure to use them for a higher purpose."
  children_and_mothers:0 "Children and Mothers"
  children_and_mothers_desc:0 "The bloodthirsty savages are at our door. We are facing nothing less than the total annihilation of our way of life, as well as every member of our noble tribe. May our gods forgive us for what we will do, but we have no other choice than to send everyone into the fight, be them children barely able to swing a knife or their mother trying to protect them. The least we can do is deploy them together. May They have mercy upon our sinful souls, for our consciences will have none."
  # conscription laws NCR
  ncr_disarmed_nation:0 "Peacetime Corps"
  ncr_disarmed_nation_desc:0 "The NCR maintains a token military force, preferring to use economics and other forms of soft power to exert its influence abroad."
  ncr_volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Volunteer Military"
  ncr_volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "With the constantly emerging threat of the wasteland and neighbouring nations, it would do us well to reform our army into something more strategically sound. The NCR Senate has authorized the recruitment of volunteers to form the new military force."
  ncr_funded_militia_conscription:0 "Fully Funded Military"
  ncr_funded_militia_conscription_desc:0 "Investing even more into our organization is a sound decision, considering the state of the wasteland. Pulling funds toward the construction of military bases let us concentrate our forces even more, as well as providing a reinforced structure within which our soldiers can train more freely with their new "toys" that our taxpayers gracefully helped acquire."
  ncr_two_year_conscription:0 "Two Year Conscription"
  ncr_two_year_conscription_desc:0 "Forcing a conscription onto our population might make a lot of people very unhappy, but it is sadly a decision we will have to take to prepare properly. To minimize the effects of conscription, a two year rotation will be put into law, which should provide our conscripts with some breathing room and a light at the end of the tunnel."

  ncr_four_year_conscription_desc:0 "Extending the conscription to a four year rotation will considerably increase our available manpower, but with it comes consequences. Massive funding has to be allocated to train conscripts to a decent standard for our army, and moral is slowly degrading even if our citizens understand our situation. We must be careful if we are to go further."
  ncr_until_dismissal_conscription:0 "Service Until Dismissal"
  ncr_until_dismissal_conscription_desc:0 "As of now, our government has officially declared a state of emergency. Every conscription centre is to pull overtime, and conscripts will only be dismissed when we deem them no longer useful, or the emergency passes. With moral now plummeting as civilians are even pulled from the factories and their homes, we must remember we are doing this to preserve our way of life."
  ncr_child_conscription:0 "War Never Changes"
  ncr_child_conscription_desc:0 "Civilians ripped from their homes, fathers, mothers; sons, daughters. But what choice do we have against the apocalypse? Are we to leave ourselves perish, are we not to rage against our fate until the bitter end? Already, the forced conscriptions and training leave kind-hearted people into empty shells. Our nation might never forgive us. Our citizens will hate us, our officers will resent us, and our culture might never recover fully. But it is all worth it if only to leave a hateful nation standing. Damned be the wasteland for leaving us no choice, and damned be our souls for going down this path. War truly never changes."
# conscription laws NCN
  ncn_disarmed_nation:0 "Peacetime Corps"
  ncn_disarmed_nation_desc:0 "New Canaan is largely reliant on tribal auxiliaries for protection, only maintaining a token military force that's mostly geared towards internal policing."
  ncn_volunteer_militia_conscription:0 "Volunteer Military"
  ncn_volunteer_militia_conscription_desc:0 "With the constantly emerging threat of the wasteland and neighbouring nations, it would do us well to reform our army into something more strategically sound. New Canaan is now openly recruiting and training volunteers into its new military force."
