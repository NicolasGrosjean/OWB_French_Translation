  nf_gente.1.t: "The Child of the Sun"
  nf_gente.1.d: "If you ask the Generalissimo, even as a child all knew he was destined for greatness. He will gladly tell you that he was born under a solar eclipse, although he is oddly reticent on which one. And he took after the sun, for he was:"
  nf_gente.1.a: "As bright as the sun."
  nf_gente.1.b: "As constant as the sun."
  nf_gente.1.c: "As fierce as the sun."

  nf_gente.2.t: "The Menace from the Deep!"
  nf_gente.2.d: "Thirty years ago, El Generalissimo was peacefully providing voluntary protection to the people of Puerto Libertad when monstrous cangrejos emerged from the depths. When the leader of his troop fled, El Generalissimo rallied the men and coordinated their attacks brilliantly! When the dust was cleared, the people of Puerto Libertad were so grateful that they voluntarily offered leadership of their now weakly defended town to the young soldier. And several of the women of the town voluntarily offered something else. \n\nAnd the people feasted! "
  nf_gente.2.a: "A great hero!"
  nf_gente.2.b: "A cunning hero!"
##############################################
  nf_gente.3.t: "The Free Exchange of Ideas and Ammunition"
  nf_gente.3.d: "Despite what [FFI.GetLeader] says, El Generalissimo has proven to be a capable ruler. He may enjoy his margaritas and mujeres, but what leader doesn't? He has turned Gente into a prosperous city. But its prosperity rests, to a large degree, on guns and mercenaries."
  nf_gente.3.a: "If you've got money, he's got guns!"
  nf_gente.3.a_tt: "Prioritize selling guns."
  nf_gente.3.b: "Prioritize producing guns."
  nf_gente.3.c: "Prioritize building tools to build guns."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.4.t: "The Setting Sun?"
  nf_gente.4.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has decided Los Luchadores Libres are too great a threat to his oppression, and is preparing to march south! Whatever. He might have been a hero back in the day, but he's spent the last few years drinking margaritas and engaging in a personal fitness regimen. How could he seriously pose a threat to us?"
  nf_gente.4.a: "We'll host wrestling matches in his villa."
  nf_gente.4.a_tt: "[GDH.GetNameWithFlag] has a wargoal upon you..."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.6.t: "A Little Party Never Killed Nobody"
  nf_gente.6.d: "Rum and coffee, fine cigars, brahmin with just the right hit of chilli; say what you will about the Baron, he has panache. And so [GDH.GetLeader] and [CAF.GetLeader] are willing to discuss business ties; El Generalissimo is glad to open a franchise for the Baron in North-western Mexico, and the Baron will diversify his arms shipments. Everyone wins! Except the Aztlán, of course."
  nf_gente.6.a: "To new business ties!"
  nf_gente.6.b: "We should party more often!"
  nf_gente.6.c: "El Generalissimo could use a brand new car..."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.7.t: "A Better Tomorrow, Today!"
  nf_gente.7.d: "Vault-Tec kept design schematics for a series of advanced weapons of war in the Vault. Unfortunately, we lack the tools to make the tools needed to make most of the equipment here.  With a concerted economic effort, we can develop pre-war technology, but we have to decide.  Will we pursue robotics, planes, or vehicles? "
  nf_gente.7.a: "Robots are really Mexico's schtick."
  nf_gente.7.b: "We can use the planes to go parasailing!"
  nf_gente.7.c: "El Generalissimo could use a brand new car..."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.8.t: "The Pool!"
  nf_gente.8.d: "As El Generalissimo sipped a margarita on his patio, he could not help reflect how good life had been. He had made friends, won much, lost some, won most of what he lost back, gambled in New Vegas, toured the ruins of Mexico City, and seen what he was still convinced was a horse. And who knew what the future would hold?"
  nf_gente.8.a: "Some fancy ships!"
  nf_gente.8.b: "We can use the planes to go parasailing!"
  nf_gente.8.c: "El Generalissimo could use a brand new car..."

  nf_gente.10.t: "[GDH.Capital.GetName] aligned with [RRG.Capital.GetName]"
  nf_gente.10.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has spurned ties with the Legion, aligning with the profligates of the Republic of the Rio Grande. We'll keep this in mind, and we'll see them crucified outside their villa yet."
  nf_gente.10.a: "Degenerates like him belong on a cross."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.11.t: "An Offer We Could Refuse, But Why?"
  nf_gente.11.d: "We have received an unusual offer from Mexico. It appears that [GDH.GetLeader] is willing to sell guns to us. Although this is not really our area of focus, we could use every gun we can get given the threats that we face. And hey, do you really trust the Gun Runners? I sure don't."
  nf_gente.11.a: "Pleasure doing business!"
  nf_gente.11.a_tt: "\nWe gain access to El Generalissimo's market!"
  nf_gente.11.b: "Sorry, we hate adequate armaments."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.12.t: "Sweet Home California"

  #############################################
  nf_gente.14.t: "Her Special Day"
  nf_gente.14.d: "The band quieted down, the attendees were having a good time on the balcony over the sea, and El Generalissimo smiled.  'My dearest daughter, this will one day all be yours. And I know you will do more with it than I did.' He sniffed a tear. 'When I look at you, I see your mother, and I know she would be proud of who you have become.  And that's why I wanted to give you something in her name.'  \n\nTwo soldiers came out with a large box, wrapped in Aztláni silks. 'Your mother designed this when you were a baby, but we didn't know how to build it. But now we do.'  \n\n Lucia walked to her father, her pink dress trailing behind her. She carefully unwrapped the box, and found a gauss rifle within.  The hilt was carved with a picture of her mother holding her as a baby, surrounded by a heart.  'Lucia, we will always be with you, in one way or another. I love you.'"
  nf_gente.14.a: "Family makes it all worthwhile."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.15.t: "One Man, One Vote!"
  nf_gente.15.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has expected to win this sham election, but he may face a surprise. His dear comrade, Maria Izquierdo, has a dream. A [GDH.GetName] with no Generalissimo, where the people's vote actually does matter.  Once she has established stability after an interim regime of indefinite duration, of course. \n\nIt was the night before the election, when the ballot boxes had been duly stuffed.  El Generalissimo always had a taster check his drink, but he trusted Izquierdo. And a ghoul was immune to many poisons...."
  nf_gente.15.a: "To Your Inauguration, Presidente!"
  nf_gente.15.b: "Drink Up, Generalissimo!"
  #############################################
  nf_gente.16.t: "A Trade Caravan from [GDH.Capital.GetName]"
  nf_gente.16.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has sent another convoy to us.  We will profit greatly from this friendship. Although [GDH.GetLeader] is a Profligate who, some would say, belongs on a cross, perhaps there is still a use for him."
  nf_gente.16.a: "Strange times make for strange friends."
  #############################################
  nf_gente.17.t: "[GDH.GetLeader] sent a caravan to Flagstaff!"
  nf_gente.17.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has sent more resources to Flagstaff.  This is not good for Rio, not good at all..."

  nf_gente.21.a: "Why would we care about this scrap of land?"
  nf_gente.21.a_tt: "You will sell Nogales for 400 caps."

  nf_gente.24.d: "[GDH.GetLeader] has asked to negotiate a treaty of eternal peace and further promote trade ties. While we find much about him rather contemptuous, he does have a stile to rival [CES.GetLeader], and has been a useful trading partner. What shall we do?"

  nf_gente.24.a_tt: "\nThis will form a non-aggression pact with [GDH.GetNameWithFlag]."

  nf_gente.33.d: "El Generalissimo has decided that his people wish to honour him with a wonderful villa. But this will not merely be a palatial estate pools on the Pacific. There will be manicured parks for the people! Schools for the children! Oh, and this is also a cover to loot a vault beneath the construction site. \n\nHowever, the General is getting crotchety in his old age, and everyone is happy to give him advice on how to build the villa. This can be stressful!"
  nf_gente.33.a: "Wasn't the point of the villa to relax?"
  nf_gente.33.a_tt: "\nThis unlocks a timed mission to finish the villa. Completing additional focuses will unlock ways to delay or speed up construction at a cost in stress. "
