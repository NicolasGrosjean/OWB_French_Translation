  nf_kaiser.1.t: "Prince and the Pauper"
  nf_kaiser.1.d: "Recently, a mythological occurrence happened after Caesar took a brief rest to pray to Mars during his conquest of the Twin Hairs…\nIt seems that Caesar is ‘gone’ - Replaced in a puff of heated smoke with another, still wearing Caesar’s clothes. This man had a beard, seemed out of their shoes and looked delirious.\n\nYet, the tribes saw this another way. They proclaimed him Mars Incarnate: A personification of the deity they worshipped in Caesar here to win their battles for them. It was a hard title for the man to accept over the few days of rest he was allowed after his arrival, yet it was one he wasn’t given much choice in taking on.\n\nAmid the celebrations, the Malpais Legate - noticing something familiar about the man would approach closer.\nThat wasn’t Mars, that was fucking Kaiser Wilhelm!"
  nf_kaiser.1.a: "Oh no."
  nf_kaiser.1.tt: "§YKaiser Wilhelm§! becomes the leader of §Ythe Legion§!."
  nf_kaiser.2.t: "A Great Offer"
  nf_kaiser.2.d: "The new "Kaiser" of the Legion has given us a particular offer: If we were to join up with them they would give us some of the old Ranger equipment they took from the old NCR holdings east of the Colorado. This would allow our group to effectively be the new "Arizona Rangers". A lucrative offer!"
  nf_kaiser.2.a: "I knew I would always make a handsome ranger."
  nf_kaiser.2.b: "We aren't rangers!"
  nf_kaiser.3.t: "Question of the Twisted Hairs"
  nf_kaiser.3.d: "Seems we have been left with one of Caesar's last wars on our plate. Some of our men expect us to continue this war - but really, we have no desire for the war path Caesar went on towards the west. We could always try to amend our groups issues and form a military pact if need be."
  nf_kaiser.3.a: "Finishing off this war is for the best."
  nf_kaiser.3.b: "Perhaps a alliance is best?"
  nf_kaiser.4.t: "Terrible Tuesday!"
  nf_kaiser.4.d: "It seems that one of Caesar's old subordinates, one "Legate Lanius" has decided to use this chance to rise up in the east. They have no intention of fighting us - simply stating that they don't feel that we are fit to continue in Caesar's legacy of conquest. That we are "too soft". With Lanius splitting off that will lead to nearly half of our industry breaking off as well - this is a disaster!"
  nf_kaiser.4.a: "I have lived through worse."
  nf_kaiser.4.b: "§RWeak men shouldn't rule.§!"
  nf_kaiser.5.t: "The Cowboys Refuse!"
  nf_kaiser.5.d: "Looks like they don't trust us. Perhaps we will have to show them how we feel through force?"
  nf_kaiser.5.a: "A good idea."
  nf_kaiser.6.t: ""Reformation" of the Arizona Rangers"
  nf_kaiser.6.d: "The new leader of the Legion, the “Kaiser” has, through diplomacy seemed to attempt to make amends between the NCR and the Legion through the recreation of the Arizona Rangers!\nOn closer inspection to some, it would seem that these Rangers aren’t “actually” Rangers - but merely tribals wearing Ranger equipment. It’s probably for the best not to tell them that though!"
  nf_kaiser.6.a: "Interesting."

  nf_kaiser.7.t: "Crawl Out Through the Fallout"
  nf_kaiser.7.d: "No, Mighty, err, Kaiser, I do not recall learning about a German invasion of America. I know that Europe was wrecked by endless petty wars before the Great War, so that part sounds plausible.  The Great War ended in 2077, when America fought the Chinese over the last of the world's oil. Were they syndicalist? I don't know, can you explain to me what syndicalism is? \n\nAfter the bombs fell, Arizona and New Mexico was a lawless wasteland. Until you came, bringing the light of civilization. You used the secrets of the Old World."
  nf_kaiser.7.a: "Lasers? Robots? Wunderbar!"
  national_spirit_we_love_lasers: "A Better Western"
  nf_kaiser.7.b: "Power armour will let us create a new knighthood!"
  national_spirit_teutonic_knights: "The Neutonic Knights"

  nf_kaiser.8.t: "What do you mean, there was a Third Weltkrieg?"
  nf_kaiser.8.d: "Germany won the first Weltkrieg due to our INDOMITABLE MIGHT. The Second Weltkrieg was a little tougher. It was a truly world war, with German forces fighting in the jungles of Vietnam, the savannahs of Africa, the steppes of Russia, and I can only assume the cities of the New World. I can't remember a lot of details when I left. In fact I'm not sure we actually started the Second Weltkrieg. Or who we fought... And now you're telling me there was another Great War? Does that mean German hegemony did not endure for a thousand years?"
  nf_kaiser.8.a: "We won through our industrial might!"
  national_spirit_engineering: "Prussian Steel"
  nf_kaiser.8.b: "We won through our German engineering!"
  national_spirit_research: "Einstein's Legacy!"

  nf_kaiser.9.t: "Be Serious, Man"
  nf_kaiser.9.d: "'Look,' the Kaiser declared, 'if America has intervened in the Weltkrieg and defeated Germany, I would have known about it. And the idea that Russia would be the heartland of some syndicalist knock off? This is just dumb.' \n\nMalpais Legate frowned. 'OK, but you're also telling me about a world where America fell to communism and some senator from New England forms a bloody empire.' \n\n'You don't know syndicalists,' said Wilhelm. 'Trust me, it's quite possible.' \n\n'I am pretty sure America was not communist before the Great War. so call me sceptical, mighty Kaiser. Next you'll tell me about unicorns forming an alliance to restore harmony to the Wasteland, or a Martian invasion!'"
  nf_kaiser.9.a: "Syndicalists did have some good ideas."
  nf_kaiser.9.b: "Actually, we learned a lot from their death rays."
