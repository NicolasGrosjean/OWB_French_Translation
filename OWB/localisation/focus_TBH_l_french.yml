 tbh_nf_rhombus_chase:9 "The Long March West"
 tbh_nf_rhombus_chase_desc:9 "The Attis Army’s flight to Texas brought the Texan Brotherhood to bear against them. Split from the Western Brotherhood, High Elder Rhombus led a contingent of men west in pursuit of Attis’ goons."
 tbh_nf_national_guard:9 "Always Ready, Always There"
 tbh_nf_national_guard_desc:9 "A difficult situation awaited them upon reaching Texas. Approached by remnants of the old National Guard looking for a safe haven for themselves and their families, Rhombus was forced to decide how to best use their talents for the Brotherhood's cause."
 tbh_nf_texas_rangers:9 "One Ranger, One Riot"
 tbh_nf_texas_rangers_desc:9 "Members of the elite Texas Rangers were the next group to approach the Expedition. Runner’s formidable expertise played a key role in preparing the Brotherhood for the upcoming conflict."
 tbh_nf_rhombus_legacy:9 "The Wake of a Giant"
 tbh_nf_rhombus_legacy_desc:9 "Grievously wounded near the conclusion of the campaign, Rhombus’ life hung on a razor’s edge."
 tbh_nf_development_1:9 "Dallas Developments"
 tbh_nf_development_1_desc:9 "The ruins of Dallas have proven a very effective fundament for civilian life to flourish under Brotherhood governance, let us further this with subtle involvements. The best economy is a guided economy."
 tbh_nf_development_2:9 "Fort Hood Developments"
 tbh_nf_development_2_desc:9 "Below the city of Hood lies a fort, an old military base that to this day nobody managed to fully crack open. But even the surface is litered with useful salvage that we can use to our advantage."
 tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought:9 "Doctrinal Thoughts"
 tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_desc:9 "Our high command must never stop adapting to the constantly shifting conditions of the wastes if we are to maintain military readiness in the harshest of situations. Providing them further resources and reports would help them make capital advances in improving the established doctrines of our troops as well as special forces."
 tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_2:9 "Evaluate the Codex"
 tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_2_desc:9 "The Brotherhood strategical codex has, for the longest time, been followed to the letter. But if we are to adapt to our new situation we must study it in-depth and interpret it more as recommendations than as a strict guideline. It can, however, still teach us a few additional tricks."
 tbh_nf_our_path_roots:9 "Texas for Rusk"
 tbh_nf_our_path_roots_desc:9 "Rusk is right, what the wasteland need isn't another common army oppressing it's citizen and focusing more on waging war than on ensuring peace. Our oath was and still is to this day to enact the law and protect our citizen against the harsh conditions they must endure daily. We cannot abandon this crucial task, lest we forget our pledge."
 tbh_nf_our_path_roots_2:9 "Rusk for Texas"
 tbh_nf_our_path_roots_2_desc:9 "Our brotherhood must be able to react to trouble quickly, and efficiently, if we are to secure our lands. Separating our forces into independent policing cells that can rapidly gain knowledge of the local terrain and it's population lets us react much faster to threats once reinforcements arrive, able to be directed quickly by local officers."
 tbh_nf_roots_new_recruits:9 "Brotherhood Expansion"
 tbh_nf_roots_new_recruits_desc:9 "If we are to protect our nation we will need additional volunteers, and a lot of them. Our pledge to bring security and order seems to already be an extremely effective way to make the people trust us. All we need to do is spread our recruitment intentions far and wide, and recruits will come flowing through the door."
 tbh_nf_roots_new_weapons:9 "Brotherhood Guns"
 tbh_nf_roots_new_weapons_desc:9 "Our complacency and over-reliance on existing technology could very well be our downfall in our fight to bring order to the wastes. If we are to make sure our forces are properly equipped for the battles ahead, we must do all we can to spur small arms innovation, be it civilian competition, research funds or even soldier-led design initiatives."
 tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores:9 "The Fork Less Taken"
 tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_desc:9 "Rusk is, of course, a respected and honorable elder that has guided our Brotherhood correctly time and time again. But, if we are to be prepared for war, we must reform our troops to be a standing military, not a peacekeeping force. We will move away from the existing doctrines and invent a new way to truly render the wasteland safe."
 tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_2:9 "Journey's Conclusion"
 tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_2_desc:9 "Our reforms have proven effective already, but we cannot stop here. We must do all we can to never fall behind our enemies in terms of technology. We will fund and equip various research cells across the country, dedicated to giving us the most advanced weaponry and equipment. Our technological edge will be key to our future efforts."
 tbh_nf_shores_new_tactics:9 "New Tactics"
 tbh_nf_shores_new_tactics_desc:9 "With our divisions moving away from Rusk's ideas of peacekeepers, we must revise our tactics and strategies to adapt to open warfare. A new group of military officers fresh out of the academy, full of ideas, and eager to prove their capabilities, should be able to do just that."
 tbh_nf_shores_new_vehicles:9 "New Vehicles"
 tbh_nf_shores_new_vehicles_desc:9 "If we are to wage war accross open terrain we must be able to move swiftly and efficiently move through the wastes, and for that we need vehicles. We will announce a vast program to reward anyone able to present us with innovations or even new designs, spurring breakthroughs while modernizing our military."
 tbh_nf_protector_of_texas:9 "Protector of Texas"
 tbh_nf_protector_of_texas_desc:9 "The complete reform and transformation of our forces now complete, we can impose ourselves as the true protector of Texas and all Texans that live within it. Whether they want it or not, they will quickly learn that none can outrun or outmatch the us. For Rusk, for the Union!"
 tbh_nf_listening_posts:9 "Establish Listening Posts"
 tbh_nf_listening_posts_desc:9 "In matters of war, reconnaissance is one of it's most essential aspect. Lack of intel can make or break any operations, as such it is capital to our efforts that we gain said intel rapidly. The establishment of radar-equipped listening posts, manned by trained specialists, will let us do just that."
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes:9 "Brotherhood Exercizes"
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_desc:9 "Close study of the exercises undertaken by every new recruit in our forces can give you good insight into their thinking, of particular interest is the fact some of the more clever members can sometime outright bypass obstacles in courses or difficulties in training, which we should specially pay attention to."
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_2:9 "Brotherhood Training"
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_2_desc:9 "The Brotherhood codex contains immense amount of military records from various campaigns dating back to it's creation, which is included both as a mean of remembrance and as lessons for future officers. Requiring our high command to study it and apply it's teaching would be beneficial."
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_3:9 "Brotherhood Regimen"
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_3_desc:9 "Immense inter-division mock battles, executed on neutral fields between rookie officers, is a good way to give battle experience to both our command corp as well as soldiers on the ground, and quickly find any flaw in our equipment or tactical teachings."
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_4:9 "Brotherhood Drills"
 tbh_nf_national_excersizes_4_desc:9 "Vastly reformed army drills, combined with a veteran oversight system, can let us impart the wisdom of our more experienced soldiers onto our recruits, letting them benefit from vast tactical knowledge before even hitting the field."
 tbh_nf_mister_entertainment:9 "Live From Dallas"
 tbh_nf_mister_entertainment_desc:9 "Who doesn’t love a good show? We’ll approach Mr. Entertainment for a networking deal. With any luck, camaraderie and common appreciation for good television will seal the deal."
 tbh_nf_a_mutually_benefitial_deal:9 "Forge the Deal"
 tbh_nf_a_mutually_benefitial_deal_desc:9 "We'll draft the Telecommunications act, hopefully allowing Mr. Entertainment free passage and access to all Texan Economic Union lands, along with our protection. In exchange, we'll receive electronic equipment, intel and a positive limelight in his show."



 tbh_nf_consolidate_conquests:9 "Brotherhood Consolidation"
 tbh_nf_consolidate_conquests_desc:9 "Newfound gains are only any good if we shore them up. By spending time to plan our administration of these territories we guarantee their place as core elements of our nation."
 tbh_nf_form_texas_yehaw:9 "Provisional Statehood"
 tbh_nf_form_texas_yehaw_desc:9 "Our hard work has all led to this. With the Texan Economic Union as strong as ever, we’re prepared to form a Provisional Republic of Texas and solidify our place as protectors of Texan peace."
 tbh_nf_alamo_is_a_thing:9 "Once Mighty, Once United"
 tbh_nf_alamo_is_a_thing_desc:9 "The Alamo Chapter has broken from our control, causing a major crisis."
 tbh_nf_the_hard_road:9 "The Hard Road"
 tbh_nf_the_hard_road_desc:9 "Our officer corp suffered greatly from the Alamo Chapter’s split, meaning we’ll need to undertake major efforts to revitalize our army. The shortest path to doing so also requires the largest investment, and therefore largest risk."
 tbh_nf_the_long_road:9 "The Long Road"
 tbh_nf_the_long_road_desc:9 "Our army may be in disarray, but there’s a calm solution to every problem. An extensive training campaign will take time, however anything rasher actions could place us in serious peril."
 tbh_nf_combat_our_deficits:9 "Combat our Deficits"
 tbh_nf_combat_our_deficits_desc:9 "The Alamo’s split shone light on the failures of our current protection program. Far too minimalistic, it prioritizes a minimalistic and functioning fighting force over a fully prepared infantry corp."
 tbh_nf_all_systems_ready:9 "All Systems Ready"
 tbh_nf_all_systems_ready_desc:9 "Our efforts have borne fruit. The lessons we’ve learned today will inform the Brotherhood’s doctrine for generations to come. Although not all is well, we’ve managed to restore a sense of normalcy to our operations."
 tbh_nf_our_fatman:9 "Tactical Nuclear Catapult"
 tbh_nf_our_fatman_desc:9 "Although full-scale warheads are certainly out of our reach, miniaturized nuclear bombs might soon be a reality on our battlefields. Extra training will be required, but the payoffs will be, well, nuclear. "

  # Economic Union Stuff
 tbh_rekindle_economic_union:9 "Rekindle the Economic Union"
 tbh_rekindle_economic_union_desc:9 "Whilst once a great strength of our nation, we've allowed the Texan Economic Union to fizzle out while we were busy fighting the Hand Warband. We must reverse this!"
 tbh_two_nations_one_system:9 "Two Nations - One System"
 tbh_two_nations_one_system_desc:9 "By tightly integrating the economy of ourselves and the other members of the Texan Economic Union, we're able to reap significant economic benefits. Long may this last!"
 tbh_develop_join_arms_production:9 "Develop Joint Arms Production"
 tbh_develop_join_arms_production_desc:9 "By augmenting [LNS.GetName]'s industrial might with [TBH.GetNameDef]'s military expertise, we could significantly increase our military output!'"
 tbh_announce_fiscal_reform:9 "Announce Fiscal Reform"
 tbh_announce_fiscal_reform_desc:9 "Whilst the Texan Economic Union is strong, it's certainly not infallible. Reforming our finances will help shore us up."
 tbh_expand_inter_nation_inf:9 "Expand Inter-Nation Infrastructure"
 tbh_expand_inter_nation_inf_desc:9 "If we are to really make the Texan Economic Union boom, we should expand the infrastructure near our mutual borders to encourage cross-border trade."
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission:9 "Enlarge the Mission to Lone Star"
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_desc:9 "With some expenditure of political capital, we could enlarge the mission to Lone Star sent by [TBH.GetNameDef]. This would greatly increase our military knowledge!"
 tbh_enlargen_lns_mission:9 "Enlarge the Mission to [TBH.GetNameDef]"
 tbh_enlargen_lns_mission_desc:9 "If we were to expend some political effort, we could ensure that a larger delegation is sent to [TBH.GetNameDef], ensuring they continue to expand their industry."
 tbh_adopt_texan_dollar:9 "Mint the Texan Dollar"
 tbh_adopt_texan_dollar_desc:9 "To inspire inter-nation trade within the Texan Economic Pact, it has been decided that we should establish the Texan Dollar. A bold idea indeed."
 tbh_focus_on_new_research:9 "Focus on New Research"
 tbh_focus_on_new_research_desc:9 "Part of the job of the Economic Union is pushing the boundaries of what we believed economically possible. The best way to do that is to develop new technologies!"
 tbh_restore_texas_uni:9 "Restore the University of Texas"
 tbh_restore_texas_uni_desc:9 "Once a great institution of learning and research, the old campus of the University of Texas lies in ruin. With some love, we could begin to restore academic research to the location, granting us all benefits."
 tbh_share_tech_development:9 "Share Technological Developments"
 tbh_share_tech_development_desc:9 "The Texan Economic Union can gain new heights of power if it is to share technology amongst its members equally."
 tbh_form_central_bank:9 "Form the Central Bank of Texas"
 tbh_form_central_bank_desc:9 "To ensure our currency is always backed up by gold, we must establish a central bank. This will greatly strengthen the Economic Union."

 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_basic_drills_desc:9 "The advisory mission to Lone Star has been a vast success, with our officers able to identify several flaws in their training regiment when compared to our own troops. Advising them further with the objective of streamlining their military drills could be beneficial for their defensive capabilities."
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_advanced_drills:9 "Advanced Training Programs"
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_advanced_drills_desc:9 "The military advisors we have sent to our neighbors have already provided many wisdoms to help them prop up their militaries. They have, however, made us aware of several possible improvement to squad cohesion training and tactical movement drills that, with time and efforts, they could implement."
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_rangers_for_lonestar:9 "Rangers for Lonestar"
 tbh_enlargen_tbh_mission_rangers_for_lonestar_desc:9 "Increasing the size of our military mission even further to encompass experienced officers and Lawmen in addition to the soldiers already present in Lone Star could, in addition to army reforms, provide strategical training to their own commanding officers, and help with general peacekeeping as a sign of goodwill."
 tbh_nf_mobilization:9 "Limited Deputization"
 tbh_nf_mobilization_desc:9 "Deputies serve their purpose, but perhaps it’s best that they be few and well trained as opposed to numerous and ineffective. Let’s start small, and perhaps scale our deputization programs over time."
 tbh_nf_mobilization_2:9 "Commonplace Deputization"
 tbh_nf_mobilization_2_desc:9 "The capability of our deputies has opened the possibility of expanding the deputization program, at least somewhat."

 tbh_nf_mobilization_4:9 "Universal Deputization"

 tbh_nf_things_that_protect:9 "The Core of Our Corp"
 tbh_nf_things_that_protect_desc:9 "The key part of any Brotherhood army has always been its elite fighters. Although we now occupy a larger area than ever before those forces still play a key role in our military. We must be sure not to neglect them, lest we find ourselves reduced to a common army."
 tbh_nf_desperado_no_more:9 "Desperados No More"
 tbh_nf_desperado_no_more_desc:9 "Those bandits to our east have been a constant source of trouble. A short military expedition will wipe out their leaders and put their citizens under our protection."
