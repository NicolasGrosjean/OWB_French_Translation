  ces_death_in_the_canyons: "The Janus Face of Caesar"
  ces_death_in_the_canyons_desc: "Caesar's mercy after a battle was as renowned as his brutality during it.

  ces_the_malpais_legate: "The Malpais Legate"

  ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc: "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

  ces_the_white_leg_petition: "The White Legs"
  ces_the_white_leg_petition_desc: "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have come to our attention. Perhaps we can extend them our support in exchange for attacking potential threats in Utah. And should they fail . . . we can always find more tribals."

  ces_graham_execution: "The Conquest of New Canaan"
  ces_graham_execution_desc: "With the conquest of New Canaan, the Legion's influence extends throughout much of Utah.  Al that is left is mopping up whatever remains. It's not as if the Canaanites can hide in some valley, rally under some outsider's influence, and drive our proxies out, right?"

  ces_new_cohort: "New Cohort"

  ces_a_worthy_foe_desc: "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."

  ces_divide_et_impera_desc: "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."

  ces_camp_searchlight_desc: "Vulpes Inculta has come to us with a plan. The NCR Camp in the town of Searchlight could easily be sabotaged by opening some irradiated barrels of nuclear waste inside the town, irradiating the town and the NCR soldiers within."

  ces_battle_of_nipton: "Battle Of Nipton"
  ces_battle_of_nipton_desc: "The town of Nipton, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take it, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."

  ces_legion_salvagers_desc: "Dog City is a remarkable place, filled to the brim with relics untouched by fearful tribals, or protected by packs of savage hounds who have been and bred here for over a hundred years.

  ces_slaves_to_flagstaff_desc: "From all across the Four States, and beyond, the come to us. Shackled and bound, broken in spirit and mind. We shall give them purpose again, they shall work for the greatest force in the wasteland, or they shall die trying to resist it."

What better place for a Legion outpost than a den of wickedness?"

  ces_slaves_in_phoenix: "Slaves in Phoenix"
  ces_slaves_in_phoenix_desc: "All things are traded in Phoenix, among them slaves. Brought inland from slavers in both Baja, and further south in Mexico, these people do not speak our language, yet they work with the will of people who desire to one day return home.

  ces_enslave_tribals: "Enslave Tribals"
  ces_enslave_tribals_desc: "The people of Two Sun are relatively safe from Legionary conscription, yet the tribals who were under their protection are ours to claim now. The Tombwalkers, the Sun Hunters, and the Roadrunners shall be absorbed into the legion, and form the heart of a new cohort."

  ces_honestas_industria_prudentia: "Honestas, Industria, Prudentia"

  ces_fort_construction: "Fort Construction"

The Navajo Pathfinders serve the Legion, but they remain a people apart.

  ces_garage_caches_desc: "Numerous spies err... I mean numerous 'concerned citizens' have made us know that Two Sun is actually stashing and hiding numerous tributes that would be rightfully ours in their garages.

They run from the Colorado to the Rio Grande, and bind us together."
  CES_coloniae: "The Coloniae"
  CES_coloniae_desc: "With our many territories and outlying colonies being allowed to simply grow for too long, they have grown complacent and have withheld capital help from the Legion.

  CES_castellum: "The Castellum"

  CES_civilian_development_desc: "The mark of any true empire isn't only its military might, but also its commercial power.

  ces_lucius_wall: "The Commonwealth"

  ces_cult_of_mars_desc: "Finally, the enemies of the Legion were defeated. As their bodies laid broken, crucified for all to see as to show what happens to traitors, a single question remained. How could this have been allowed to happen? Fools and tin soldiers, running rampant, destroying the legacy of the mighty Legion for their own petty whims. All shall change now, the nation shall regain its true might."
  ces_perpetual_war: "Perpetual War"
  ces_perpetual_war_desc: "Our history has shown us time and time again that we cannot afford to separate matters of war with matters of governance. They must be deeply linked to one another, at the lowest level of our society. All shall know how to fire a rifle, swing a machete, hold a line. All shall know of the struggle of the mighty Legion. All shall worship Mars."
  ces_infantry_weapons: "The Arcuballistae"
  ces_infantry_weapons_desc: "Civilians, for too long, have been left aside and managed as if useless to the war machine. We will put them to work once again. All must know how to sharpen a sword, or maintain a firearm. Disabled, women, children, there is no excuse to not support the legions in every possible way, and those that refuse will be dealt with appropriately."
  ces_advanced_resources: "The Fabri Ferrari"
  ces_advanced_resources_desc: "It is extremely frustrating, if slightly amusing, that many within our lands still think themselves exempt from their duties to the Legion. Many spin vast tales of 'essential maintenance' and 'vital construction efforts', but our own experts are no fool, and know a coward when they see one. It is time they learn their lesson, and that we put them to work."
  ces_tank_weapons: "The Cataphracts"
  ces_tank_weapons_desc: "What better weapon is there to fuel our conquest than armoured vehicles? Under Caesar, their usefulness has been grossly underestimated, and their production cast aside in favour of more... 'heroic' equipment such as machetes and armor for the infantry.

By doing so we can enact a vast centralization campaign, uniting the workforce and machinery in one location in every city, putting them under our control for us to use as we please."
  ces_currency: "The Aureus"
  ces_currency_desc: "Many within our lands have dared to use the mints in Caesar's likeness for illegitimate means, bribing and corrupting their way to the top. They hoard and treasure their stock of coins, and hide from us just as cockroaches would hide from a boot. They can try all they want, but now that the nation is stabilized the boot of the Legion shall come down on these insects."
  ces_aureus_tt: "Something cool once we talk to caps"
  ces_imperial_arms: "The Arsenals"
  ces_imperial_arms_desc: "The civil war has shown us how fragile our military power can become in the most dire of circumstances.

  ces_wastelander_economy: "Ab Optimis Utriusque Mundi"
  ces_wastelander_economy_desc: "No longer can we afford to rely on human force and manpower alone.

Let none mock the Legion, for all shall be awed by our technological might!"

  ces_caesar_lives: "A God Among Men"
  ces_caesar_lives_desc: "Caesar's close call with both his tumour and the civil war that threatened to tear apart his entire legacy have opened his eyes. What is the use of emulating the past, if one also does not learn from its mistakes? He is sure that the true way is through the lessons of Rome, and the might of its ancient empire, but maybe a new outlook at its history is in due order..."
  ces_thesis1: "The Thesis"
  ces_thesis1_desc: "A vast reform of our philosophy is needed to consolidate our power.

  ces_respect_women: "Honour the Matrons"
  ces_respect_women_desc: "For too long we have ignored and belittled the women of the tribes under our control.

No longer, we shall show them the respect they deserve, and learn from their wisdom."

  ces_the_academy: "The Academy"
  ces_the_academy_desc: "It seems like our kind and caring words have had much more effect than we initially expected on the NCR populace. Multiple scientists, fed up with NCR interference and lack of clear support, have decided against burning their research and material like most others. Instead they have put it at our disposition in exchange for preferential treatment. We shall put this to good use."
  ces_justice: "Aequitas"
  ces_justice_desc: "Under [CES.GetLeader], the best way to imagine justice is a field that does not slant to either side. [CES.GetLeader] focuses on fairness, moderation, and even liberality, so that the meanest subject can challenge the richest merchant. This compares well to the NCR. "
  ces_respublica: "The Principate"
  ces_respublica_desc: "Caesar has always strived to become a Princeps Civitatis, the true chosen emperor of old, and he is now closer than ever. All shall become citizen and equal under the Legion's rule, for what is an empire without the trust of its populace? Just as the might of Rome was found through the Principate, so will the Legion's, and thus will it stand the test of time! SPQR!"
  ces_boring_lucius: "Lucius Prevails"
  ces_boring_lucius_desc: "The loyal Praetorian Lucius has prevailed in the civil war that has torn the Legion asunder. Hell-bent on carrying Caesar's legacy, and restoring his forces to its former might, he will make of its territory an impenetrable fortress from which the true Legion shall rise, and claim its due as conqueror of the wastes."

  ces_malpais_legate_prevails_desc: "Malpais Legate has come to behold the changes wrought upon his allegiance, and all that he sees before him is sin. How far did the mighty fall, how low did Caesar's empire decline, and how arduous the task ahead will be.

The Scorpions, who hang out at the Monte Carlo when they aren't slinging chems or getting their heads blown off by the Fiends. And of course the Fiends, a pack of drugged-out killers. They're addicted to every drug, every pill, every psychoactive enema on this fucked-up Earth.
