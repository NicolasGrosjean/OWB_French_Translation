  lac_battle_of_marathon_desc: "And the Persians, who saw the Athenians advancing toward them on the double, prepared to meet their attack; they assumed that the Athenians were seized by some utterly self-destructive madness, but they won. They chose not to reduce let their city fall to slavery; they ensured its freedom and left a memorial to all posterity.  So standing on a Persian's grave, can you deem yourself a slave?"
  lac_building_a_true_legion: "Building a True Legion"
  lac_building_a_true_legion_desc: "Soldier, what I have to offer you is fatigue, danger, struggle and death; the chill of the cold night in the free air, and heat under the burning sun; no lodgings, no munitions, no provisions, but forced marches, dangerous watch-posts and the continual struggle with the bayonet against batteries;- - those who love freedom may follow me."
  lac_equites: "The Equites"
  lac_equites: "We need the support of not just the warriors to prevail against time. Let the merchants and the craftsmen stand with us as well."

  lac_hastati: "The Hastati"

  lac_testudo: "The Testudo"
  lac_testudo_desc: "The Testudo is another of Diana's ideas.  We will use small unit tactics where warriors support one another with concentrated fire and movement, acting as one. Aye, this will make it harder for any one soldier to win glory - but victory has a thousand fathers."
  lac_quincunx: "The Quincunx"
  lac_quincunx_desc: "The needs of total war push our lands to the breaking point.  This new coin can help to pay our soldiers, although it will weaken faith in the coin of the Legion."
  lac_liberti: "Libertas"
  lac_liberti_desc: "Some of the profligates we once enslaved may fight for us, if we grant them freedom. So be it - for did I not promise to set the Wastes free, in ways they could not imagine?"

  lac_spores: "The Mighty Trees"
  lac_spores_desc: "They say Lanius took a walk into the woods, and came out taller than the trees. Even mother nature obeys his commands."

  lac_skilled_arial_gliders_desc: "And Lanius said of all the animals, he envied the eagle the most; for it flew high, and cracked its food upon the rocks below."
  lac_a_gift_from_the_factory: "A Gift From the Factory"
  lac_a_gift_from_the_factory_desc: "They say beware of gods bearing gifts - but is this not a sacred honour from the Moon? Who but the Chosen One of the gods could deserve a G.E.C.K.?"
  lac_terra_firma: "Esto Perpetua"
  lac_terra_firma_desc: "We are not in the situation of poor Alexander the Great, who wept, as well indeed he might, because there were no more worlds to conquer.  To make justice in the broken shards of this world, there is enough to do, in war or peace, to keep our risible muscles and our pens going until the end of days."
  lac_confronting_loyalists: "Confronting Loyalists"
  lac_confronting_loyalists_desc: "Wars, both civil and foreign, I undertook throughout the world, on sea and land, and when victorious I spared all citizens who sued for pardon. The foreign nations which could with safety be pardoned I preferred to save rather than to destroy."

  lac_edict_of_caracalla: "The Edict of Roswell"
  lac_edict_of_caracalla_desc: "It is most fitting that, as I ascribe the causes and the reasons of fate to the gods, I should give thanks to them for their faith in me. So let me make my offerings to the gods with the foreigners who have served with me,and grant all subjects of the Legion the title of citizen.  For is it not right and proper that all should share in my glory, to enhance the majesty of the people?"
  lac_promise_land_rights: "Land Rights"

  lac_outsmart_the_enemy: "Outsmart The Enemy"
  lac_outsmart_the_enemy_desc: "It is much better to overcome the enemy by famine, surprise or terror than by general actions, for in the latter instance fortune has often a greater share than valour. Those designs are best which the enemy are entirely ignorant of till the moment of execution. Opportunity in war is often more to be depended on than courage."
  lac_war_prep_1: "The Greatest Smile"
  lac_war_prep_1_desc: "“The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value. I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from distress and grow. Let us therefore smile at Caesar and his pretensions."
  lac_war_prep_2: "The Band of Brothers"
  lac_war_prep_2_desc: "Caesar asks you to fight for his glory, and for his cause. But you should fight for your glory. For this is not a triumph for me. It is a triumph for all who fight with me. My victory is yours, and yours is mine."
  lac_war_prep_3: "The Volunteers"
  lac_war_prep_3_desc: "Do not call me a dictator, or a monster. The whole of New Mexico voluntarily took an oath of allegiance to me and demanded me as its leader in the war."
  lac_war_prep_4: "The Cornerstone of Empire"
  lac_war_prep_4_desc: "The men and women who supply my forces are a humourless lot, but, then, they know that if I lose, they will be the first I slay.  but that is because the line between victory and defeat, all too often, depends on logistics."
  lac_war_prep_1a: "The Ways of the Warrior"
  lac_war_prep_1a_desc: "Caesar and I differ in one key respect - I will never see my cause fail, for I will die in the last ditch."
  lac_war_prep_1b: "Cut Back Spending"
  lac_war_prep_1b_desc: "If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity. Let us not treat our soldiers' lives like caps at some profligate's bar."
  lac_the_looting_of_flagstaff: "The Sack of Flagstaff"
  lac_the_looting_of_flagstaff_desc: "As Lanius watched Flagstaff burn, he was wrapped long in thought. For all cities, nations, and rulers must, in the end, meet their doom; that is what happened to America, the Lambda, and to the empires of Greece and Rome.

  lac_destroy_the_reservation: "Reservations About Separatism"
  lac_destroy_the_reservation_desc: "While Caesar profited from trade with the Reservation, we can only imagine the grim fate that awaits the many slaves who go into those lands but do not come out. It is time to end this once and for all."

  lac_city_of_lights: "The Glowing Day"
  lac_city_of_lights_desc: "Dayglow is the greatest of California's cities, and a bustling port on the wine dark sea. We could do worse than move there, and look upon the horizon. Perhaps we will find out lies beyond our vision."
  lac_alliance_with_the_omertas: "The Importance of Family"
  lac_alliance_with_the_omertas_desc: "The Omertas are the greatest of the Vegas families and crucial to its wealth. While some may wish for their destruction, a good shepherd shears his sheep; he does not flay them."
  lac_the_grand_lighthouse: "The Great Lighthouse"

  lac_challenge_the_brotherhoods: "Challenge the Brotherhoods"
  lac_challenge_the_brotherhoods_desc: "What is the Brotherhood? A dead end. Hiding and hoarding with no purpose in life beyond shrinking from fear. When they are gone, who will remember them?"
  lac_veg: "Take Out Vegas"
  lac_veg_desc: "For the cowards in Vegas who think their wealth is the salvation of mankind, they will find coins are a worse ammunition. But perhaps they can pay the tolls on the highway of the dead."
  lac_new_california: "To the Western Shores"
  lac_new_california_desc: "The NCR's people suffer under a bloated, dying aristocracy. They call themselves servants of the people, but ever since Queen Tandi died its leader wallowed in filth while people hungered.

  lac_invite_sleepers: "The Sleepers Must Awaken"

And now they lie in ruins.  \n\nUntil now."
  lac_the_phoenix_agreement: "The Phoenix Agreement"
  lac_the_phoenix_agreement_desc: "In Phoenix I restored liberty to the commons, which were oppressed by the tyranny of faction.

  lac_a_new_pantheon: "The New Pantheon"
  lac_a_new_pantheon_desc: "Lanius sacrificed to the gods to whom it was his custom to sacrifice, and gave a public banquet, seated all the Legionaries, and then any persons from the other peoples who took precedence for rank or any other high quality, and he himself and those around him drank from the same bowl and poured the same libations, with the soothsayers and priestesses initiating the ceremony."
