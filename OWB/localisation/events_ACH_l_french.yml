  # Consolidation
 nf_event_ach.1.t:0 "An Old New Focus"
 nf_event_ach.1.d:0 "While our brothers to the north cling to their dreams of restoring the old world, have we seen the truth. Technology still needs to be safeguarded until humanity is ready for it again. Until then, will we stand eternal vigil. The choice was not easy, but we all agree that it was necessary. Let us never forget our brothers, even those that decided to leave the brotherhood for promises of a restoring something that has failed time and time again."
 nf_event_ach.1.a:0 "To safeguard humanity"

  # Open the Vaults
 nf_event_ach.2.t:0 "Open the Vaults"
 nf_event_ach.2.d:0 "Even as part of the Texas branch we collected and safeguarded technology, though one of the reasons for our split was that they wanted to distribute what we guard. We can't let that happen obviously, but what of our now lonely vigil? We need every edge we can get."
 nf_event_ach.2.a:0 "No matter the cost..."

  # Richmond Demand
 nf_event_ach.3.t:0 "Richmond: We Need It"
 nf_event_ach.3.d:0 "Direct land access to the USSA headquaters is basically mandatory. Let us achieve this, by force or by finance. Let us hope that our former brothers still have some symapthy for our mission."
 nf_event_ach.3.a:0 "Purchase Richmond"

  # HRO access Send Demand
 nf_event_ach.4.t:0 "Broadcast From Central Houston"
 nf_event_ach.4.d:0 "A war is costly, but we do not need to fight if they just give us unlimited access to their facilities. But if we have to, we will take it by force. One way or another the USSA headquaters secrets will be ours."
 nf_event_ach.4.a:0 "Houston, do we have a problem?"

  # Contact West
 nf_event_ach.5.t:0 "Chains that Bind"
 nf_event_ach.5.d:0 "We failed, be it due to atmospheric issues, broken satellites or what other obstacles could be present. For our best efforts to send a signal to Lost Hills, we failed. We are... alone."
 nf_event_ach.5.a:0 "Silence has never been so cruel."

  # Houston secrets ending
 nf_event_ach.6.t:0 "Relics of the Past"
 nf_event_ach.6.d:0 "To safeguard the past is our duty, even if it is out of physical reach. Codes, equipment, satellites. Let us use them to discover, to prevent humanity from abusing technology once more. Only those worthy enough shall wield the sword."
 nf_event_ach.6.a:0 "Magnify!"


  # Back to Texas
 nf_event_ach.41.t:0 "Brothers United"
 nf_event_ach.41.d:0 "We have no other choice. We need to return, abandon what made us our ancestors Brotherhood. The way forward is not ours. It is theirs. The way forward lies in Texas. May we hope to one day return to our charge. One day, once the menace from the south has been dealt with."
 nf_event_ach.41.a:0 "Humility, perhaps, is a virtue."

  # Midwest
 nf_event_ach.42.t:0 "Unexpected Aid"
 nf_event_ach.42.d:0 "They came with faces like devils.\n\nNot from the west, but from the north-east. They decended from great airships, looking like salvation itself. The Midwest is here. Saviors in Horned and beige armour."
 nf_event_ach.42.a:0 "Does Barnaky still live?"

  # Houston Access HRO recieves
 nf_event_ach.100.t:0 "They Demand Access"
 nf_event_ach.100.d:0 "The Elder of the Alamo chapter has come forth and demanded access to our territory. We can either grant it to them or, in their words, suffer the consquences. Considering how they run about, frothing at the mouth at the mere prospect of seeing the internals of the space center? We should consider thorougly. Refusal means war."
 nf_event_ach.100.a:0 "Let them in"
 nf_event_ach.100.b:0 "Defy them"
