  # Generic Flavour Events
  flavour.1.t:0 "Unrest Amongst the Slaves"
  flavour.1.d:0 "While our slaves have never been terribly happy with their working conditions and social standing, over recent weeks it seems our slavers have become particularly rebellious to our orders. Sparked by an influential slave leader in [Root.Capital.GetName], sporadic clusters of violence against slave owners has spread across the nation in the past few days, with slaves defying orders and even attempting mass breakouts. While their core demands are little more than better conditions and food, we risk setting a dangerous precident should we bend to the slaves. Crushing them, on the other hand, would surely break the spirit of the slaves for decades to come, but could be costly in men and stability. What are we to do?"
  flavour.1.a:0 "Make minor concessions."
  flavour.1.b:0 "Crush the revolt!"
  flavour.1.c:0 "[Root.GetLeader] will crush the revolt personally!"
  flavour.2.t:0 "Traders from Hawai'i"
  flavour.2.d:0 "Far to our west, past the hulking wrecks of oil rigs and minor military islands, lies the isles of Hawai'i. Once, according to a book we once found at least, these islands were also a part of America and the home of the American Pacific Fleet. By 2077, the Pacific Fleet was a vast collection of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, destroyers and missile-boats. Most of the fleet was in port at the start of the Great War, and was wrecked by the multitude of Chinese nuclear missiles that hit the port. The tribes of this Hawai'i now make a living scrapping advanced components of the countless wrecks, trading for weapons and food with settlements up and down the West Coast. This morning a cluster of native traders from Hawai'i arrived in out ports, offering a plethora of rare goods for a price. It's an opportunity we won't get for some time!"
  flavour.2.a:0 "Come, tell us war stories from your homeland."
  flavour.2.b:0 "Buy some of their exotic goods for our people."
  flavour.2.c:0 "Strike up a year-long trade deal with them!"
  flavour.2.e:0 "Turn them away..."
  flavour.3.t:0 "Traders from Southern Empires"
  flavour.3.d:0 "In the decades that followed the Great War, radiation soaked into the great forests and jungles of South America: irradiating the wildlife and poisoning the air. The jungles drank up the radiation of those horrible warheads, slowly twisting out of all recognition into an irradiated hellhole. Once tame animals became vicious hunters, and the multitude of snakes and spiders grew in size drastically: preying on each other and the humans that remained. While South America was spared direct nuclear hits, they suffered terribly from mutated wildlife and failing crops. The survivors of the first decade would slowly regroup on the coasts and the Patagonian plateau into one of the many \"Southern Empires\": great raiding groups who controlled vast swathes of territory, always at war with each other and struggling to get by. \n\nNot all those who resided in these \"Southern Empires\" subscribed to their raiding philosophy, however. Coastal communities, retaining independence through the payment of tribute to various factions, have become wealth trade hubs. Trading animal hides and delicious rainforest fruits, these South American city-states have slowly been strengthening their trading links with nations on the Gulf of Mexico, who trade advanced components and scrap metal in exchange. A fleet of trading ships has recently docked in our ports, and offers us a rare opportunity to snap up some rare commodities. We should act quick though, as they seldom stay for long!"
  flavour.3.a:0 "Ask to learn how they cultivate these fruits."
  flavour.3.b:0 "We should pay them to teach us the art of diplomacy."
  flavour.3.c:0 "Strike up a trade deal!"
  flavour.3.e:0 "We can't make a purchace now..."
  # Unique Flavour Events
  flavour_unique.1.t:0 "The [Root.Capital.GetName] Incident"
  flavour_unique.1.d1:0 "One of the worst-kept government secrets before the Great War was the existance of \"Zetans\": extra-terrestrial beings that have been observing the human race from outer orbit. While the American government never officially acknowledged their presence (they had other things on their mind, after all), it was taken as a more-or-less certain fact by the public that these aliens were here to stay. Sure enough, the Zetans seem to still be here over two centuries after the Great War they surely watched with gleeful excitement. How do we know? Well, it seems a Zetan spacecraft has crashed near [Root.Capital.GetName]. The two Zetan occupants, identified due to their freaky resembalance to pre-war graffiti, remain alive and are putting up a solid defence of their crashed ship. A few of our soldiers have already perished when scouting it out, but surely with a co-ordinated assult we can surely overwhelm the two defenders and reach the craft."
  flavour_unique.1.d2:0 "A great comet has fallen out of the sky! Burning brighter than our fires, it crashed down to the ground from the heavens above last night. Some of our tribesmen dared approach it, hoping it was a gift from the gods, but found only death and destruction around it. Two little green men, with weapons that spewed pure light, defended the comet bravely. They must surely be the warriors of the gods, here to test us before we can reach the great comet's treasure. If we want access to the blinking lights and whirring sounds of the comet, we must defeat these holy guardians!"
  flavour_unique.1.a:0 "Leave it be..."
  flavour_unique.1.b:0 "Break it down for scrap!"
  flavour_unique.1.c:0 "Haul it away and study it."
  flavour_unique.2.t:0 "Vault 187 Opens"
  flavour_unique.2.d:0 "Much to the suprise of the residents of [Root.Capital.GetName], they have been living on top of a vast Vault-Tec experiment their entire lives. Vault 187 seems to have be a network of sub-vaults located in nearby towns, each connected by an extensive maze of tunnels sporting a significant number of man-made barricades and strewn-about skeletons. We'd identified the entrances to some of these sub-vaults before, but each appeared to have been forced open. From the accounts of the decendants of the original Vault Dwellers, this appears to have been part of the wicked experiment Vault-Tec subjected the Dwellers to. Vault-Tec opened the Vault doors to each of the sub-vaults after two years of the Great War, forcing each sub-vault to fight their way to the central chamber. Of course, the central chamber had room for but a few, and so vicious warfare broke out between the 12 sub-vaults as each vyed for control of the last radiation-free area in the Vault. After more than a decade of fighting, Vault 187-08 arose victorious, though over 8000 men, women and children died before they could achieve their goal. Then and only then was the central chamber to Vault 187 sealed and extensive food supplies were revealed, allowing the decendants of those who fought the bloody war to thrive: until today. \n\nBlinking, the first Vault Dwellers from Vault 187 emerged into the harsh sunlight of the Wasteland. Unfortunately for them, their main vault door opened right below one of our many military camps: the first Vault Dwellers were swiftly apprehended and brought before [Root.GetLeader]. Our advisors are anxiously working out what to do with the rest of the Dwellers. We could surely convince them to join us in our fight to survive the wastes, but should we keep them alive they'll certainly refuse any efforts we make to scrap their Vault. Instead, we could eliminate them with a surprise attack. Many innocents would die, but is the scrap worth it?"
  flavour_unique.2.a:0 "Teach them about the new world: they will join us."
  flavour_unique.2.b:0 "Kill them all, and scrap the newly uncovered Vault."
  flavour_unique.2.c:0 "Persuade them to join us, and then scrap their Vault!"
