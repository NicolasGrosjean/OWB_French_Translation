  ITZ_manny_torres_desc:0 "Manny Torres is, to most peasants, the most feared man in the Empire. While the Kalomte may be their ruler, Torres enforces his rule, using his I.C.D.E.B. agents to disassemble any resistance within the country."
  ITZ_Compromise: "Diego Ordaz"
  ITZ_Compromise_desc: "The Ejército and the Ti'huun have their place, but all power flows through the Kalomte and his deeds. Sick of petty divisions, Ordaz works as a mediator between political parties within the ejército and their supply chain."
  ITZ_Brahmin: "Daniela Mercado"
  ITZ_Captain: "Alonzo Tejedor"
  ITZ_Captain_desc: "One of the largest innovations of the Kalomte's rule is the establishment of smaller factories on the path to Veracruz. Large scale factories exist in the capital, but even in favourable weather, caravan travel can take ages to reach the front lines. Smaller scale workshops near the front help keep the veterans of the flower wars flush in guns and bullets."
  ITZ_Honduran_Research: "Orland Monaghan"
  ITZ_Honduran_Research_desc: "\"The concept of the Flower Wars seems to be a waste of guns and men. Perhaps it keeps the glory fed to the generals, but waging war should not be done in vain. If they have seen the troubles I have seen to the south, they would know that war is not a game.\" "

  ITZ_skimmer: "Carmelo Tamayo"
  ITZ_skimmer_desc: "The systems of exemptions for military service is often not as clear cut as some may think. By creative wording in his dictates, Tamayo has exempted much of the population of Cardenas Kaah. While some view him as another weak willed administrator, his oversight has allowed the economy of Itza to bloom."
