 cartel_distract_tlaloc:9 "Let Sleeping Gods Lie"
 cartel_distract_tlaloc_desc:9 "No matter how prepared we are for a confrontation against the Free Fighters, our best-laid plans all have one common flaw: Tlaloc. If we can no longer wait for the invalid god to simply pass away of his own accord, we must take 'proactive' steps to blind his vision."

 operation_cartel_tlalocraid_desc:9 "Tlaloc's threat of intervention has thus far crippled any retaliatory actions we could take against the Luchadores. However, the machine God is not what he used to be, and by a judicious application of 'covert coding,' we could utilise this decline to our own advantage."
 tlalocraid_setup:9 "Hack the Mainframe"
 tlalocraid_setup_desc:9 "Guided by our science division over coms, cartel operatives will hack into a local node of Tlaloc's intervention network, disabling the Ai's ability for threat assessment in our region."

 carel_maria_advisor:9 "Maria Sinaloa"
 cartel_emilia:9 "Emilia Sinaloa"
 EMILIA_SINALOA_DESC:9 "Born to dirt-poor peasants and sold to the cartel for a pouch of caps, Emilia's life has been one of complete upheaval. Displaying an aptitude for violence at a young age, Emilia quickly became a top Sicario in the Sinaloa cartel, her youthful appearance belying a vicious spirit. The Queen Regent of the cartel soon took notice, and placed the firebrand under her ward, introducing Emilia to the world of cutthroat politics and diplomacy. Emilia soon won the respect and fear of the cartel hierarchy, and after a successful stint in the heart of the Aztlani empire, was designated the heir of the Sinaloa cartel. While this honour was originally given as a formality due to the almost entirely ghoul leadership, Emilia has continued to consolidate power amongst the tenientes, and it may just be possible that one day a smoothskin will be calling the shots in Sinaloa."

 cartel_origin_blo_2_desc:9 "Brutality is a common trait amongst Mexico's villains..."
 cartel_origin:9 "Two Cartels, Both Alike in Infamy..."
 cartel_origin_desc:9 "Regardless of origin, recent defeat at the hands of the Free Fighters have united the cartels towards three goals: Get rich, get revenge, and kill anyone who gets in their way. "
 cartel_economy:9 "Keeping Control"
 cartel_economy_desc:9 "Our business model traditionally revolves around the infilitration and smuggling of contraband into foreign nations, but this has meant that the lands under our direct control have languished. Building up our domestic industry will help balance our economy and provide a semblance of stability to our territory."
 cartel_autarky:0 "Autarcie"
 cartel_autarky_desc:9 "There are very few groups willing to trade with us, meaning that the obtainment of resources has become difficult. Building a self-sustaining economic model in our territory will help rectify this issue."
 cartel_bypass_the_embargos:9 "Bypass the Embargos"
 cartel_bypass_the_embargos_desc:9 "Everyone has a price, even if they don't know it. By leveraging our considerable talents in 'dealmaking,' we can circumvent the trade embargos placed upon our territory."
 cartel_agricultural_centralisation:9 "Agricultural Centralisation"
 cartel_agricultural_centralisation_desc:9 "Very little care has been taken in the affairs of the normies, aside from the collection of 'taxes' and brutal suppression of dissent. If we reorganised the disparate homesteads into a cohesive industrial region, both of these tasks would be far more simple, and profitable."
 cartel_population_control:9 "Population Control"
 cartel_population_control_desc:9 "If the smoothksins keep leaving, we will soon become a nation of ghoul towns. Patrolling and closing down the borders of our territory will dissuade our relucatant citizens from emigrating to freer pastures."
 cartel_tax_regulation:9 "Tax Regulation"
 cartel_tax_regulation_desc:9 "Our current system of taxation is barely concealed extortion, with our subjects often being 'taxed' as many times as our enforcers feel appropriate. Reorganising our system to a more uniform, and perhaps minutely less exploitative system will increase our revenue dramatically."
 cartel_distribution_centres:9 "Distribution Centres"
 cartel_distribution_centres_desc:9 "The bombed-out remains of pre-war roads and highways are no longer sufficient to cater to our burgeoning economy. To accomadate our domestic growth, new infrastructure projects need to supplement or supercede the aging tarmacs of the old world."
 cartel_diversification:9 "Resource Diversification"
 cartel_diversification_desc:9 "Scavenging has become a large secondary industry amongst our smoothskin population, who have turned the stripping of pre-war relics into a fine art, but ruins aren't infinite, and we'll need to start properly regulating this practice before the system collapses in on itself."
 cartel_human_resources:9 "Human Resources"
 cartel_human_resources_desc:9 "It turns out, you can put a price on Humanity, and that price is quite profitable indeed."
 cartel_cash_crops:9 "Cash Crops"
 cartel_cash_crops_desc:9 "Narcotic crops are not easy to cultivate, and relying on monocultures would degrade our already meagre soil. Balancing our production with consumption-orientated crops will help nip this problem in the bud."
 cartel_economic_legitimacy:9 "Economic Legitimacy"
 cartel_economic_legitimacy_desc:9 "With a strong internal economy backing us, our neighbours can no longer dismiss us as simply another group of raiders. We have the heritage, the economy, and the sheer-bloodymindedness to become a powerful force in Mexico."
 cartel_going_legit:9 "Going Legit"
 cartel_going_legit_desc:9 "Legitimacy is a curious thing. What some consider to be standard of civilisation is more like an agreed upon lie. By greasing the hands of power across the region, we can rehabilitate the cartel legacy and become a more-or-less upstanding member of the intenational community."
 cartel_criminal_industrial_complex:9 "Criminal Industrial Project"
 cartel_criminal_industrial_complex_desc:9 "Time spent on things like 'reputation' and 'infamy' is time not spent on profit-making, and is therefore time wasted. As long as there are fools, cowards, and villains to fleece, the cartel will flourish, as it always has."
 cartel_trade:9 "The Business of Vice"
 cartel_trade_desc:9 "The Empires of Aztlan and Itza are the Cartel's first port of call when it comes to business. Thanks to the subtle pressure of the Baron and their own military obsessed focus, the druge trade in Southern Mexico is flourishing."
 cartel_gente_customs:9 "Gente Customs Union"
 cartel_gente_customs_desc:9 "The Generalissimo remains one of our only supporters in the region, on the condition that we curtail some of our more elicit operations in his territory. While unfortunate, the profits of legitimate trade with Gente more than make up for it."
 cartel_rancher_bribes:9 "Rancher Bribes"
 cartel_rancher_bribes_desc:9 "The Arizona ranchers are not long for this world, whether it be the appetites of the legion, or an expansionist Rio. While this bodes ill in the long run, for now, it makes them especially weak to our own influence."
 cartel_coastal_ecosystem:9 "Coastal Ecosystem"
 cartel_coastal_ecosystem_desc:9 "While it may seem like a violent backwater compared to the peaceful metropoles of Rio or California, the West Gulf is full of wealth, if you know where to look. Our positive relationships with the other 'alternative' nations of the gulf have allowed for an unprecedented level of economic growth, built on a foundation of highly-calculated greed."
 cartel_market_speculation:9 "National Market Speculation"
 cartel_market_speculation_desc:9 "Limiting our operations to Mexico proper demonstrates a simple lack of vision. Wherever there is a great city of vice or want, the cartel will be there, ready to provide all of life's pleasures, and also take."
 cartel_economic_incorporation:9 "The Best Minds of Mexico"
 cartel_economic_incorporation_desc:9 "Nationality and patriotism are in short supply in the 23rd century. By pooling our collective talents together, our disparate factions can better withstand the encroaches of 'order' and 'justice' that seek to destroy our lucrative way of life."
 cartel_navy:9 "Ghouls on Boats"
 cartel_navy_desc:9 "While our naval activities have traditionally been limited to smuggling operations and small-time piracy, with our operations expanding the time has come for us to build a proper navy, so as to better assert and protect our dominance of the Gulf sea."
 cartel_gulf_trade:9 "Gulf Trade"
 cartel_gulf_trade_desc:9 "Sinaloa has had a presence in the Baja even before the Bombs dropped, and while the bandido-lords who now control the peninsula may not appreciate our intrusion, our operations come with a guarantee of support for their tenuous leadership, granting us a great jumping point for smuggling further afield. "
 cartel_gunboats:9 "Junk Gunboats"
 cartel_gunboats_desc:9 "No need for fancy shipwork and extravagent design; If it floats, it's a boat."
 cartel_smuggling_caches:9 "Smuggling Caches"
 cartel_smuggling_caches_desc:9 "Resupply points along the Pacific coast are essential for successful smuggling, but are a weak point in terms of naval defense. Shoring up these points into proper naval bases will prevent an unwanted seaborne intrusion."
 cartel_hidden_compartments:9 "Hidden Compartments"
 cartel_hidden_compartments_desc:9 "Ok, perhaps a small amount of pre-planning is needed for our shipwork. Building better and more inconspicuous vessels with greater haulage is our priority."
 cartel_blockade_runners:9 "Blockade Runners"
 cartel_blockade_runners_desc:9 "A pipe-gun on a boat is pretty similar to a pipe-gun on land, only that there's a lot of water lying around if it overheats."
 cartel_depth_ghouls:9 "Depth Ghouls"
 cartel_depth_ghouls_desc:9 "While our bodies are not particularly built for aquatic activities, there are some unexpected benefits in terms of our naval capacity. Ghouls don't need much in terms of supplies, are unluckily to catch any illnesses, and while poorly suited to swimming, can hold their breath for a remarkably long time, all things considered."
 cartel_blockade_fuerte:9 "Running the Fuerte"
 cartel_blockade_fuerte_desc:9 "The blockade of the Fuerte by the luchadores has been a sore point and major economic setback, using our upgraded navy to wrest control back from those masked freaks will be a first step in our eventual revenge against the meathead menance. "
 cartel_no_more_pretense:9 "No More Pretense"
 cartel_no_more_pretense_desc:9 "We are now a true ocean-faring nation! While some of our boats might have leaks, all of them have very nasty guns, and in terms of soft power, this is the sticking point."
 cartel_river_yaqui:9 "Yaqui Harbour"
 cartel_river_yaqui_desc:9 "Yaqui would be the perfect river to establish an official trade port, one that can relieve our smaller bases and better regulate incoming goods."
 cartel_river_fuerte:9 "Fuerte Harbour"
 cartel_river_fuerte_desc:9 "With the Fuerte back under our control, it makes sense to turn this defensible inlet into a proper naval fortress to cement our power."
 cartel_river_santiago:9 "Santiago Junction"
 cartel_river_santiago_desc:9 "Rio Santiago might not be the most important river on the coast, but with our monopoly over its trade, it would be quite profitable to fully maximise our presence on the river."
 cartel_the_rio_project:9 "The Rio Project"
 cartel_the_rio_project_desc:9 "The Rio Grande is the life blood of North Mexico, and much of its wealth flows into the hands of the Rio Republic. Rio is quite short on friends in these troubling times, perhaps we can find a way to wed our diverse nations together."
 cartel_politics:9 "Time for a Shakeup"
 cartel_politics_desc:9 "Our defeat at the hands of the Luchadores has sent the cartel in a stagnant coma, forever licking wounds and plotting revenge, while our enemies grow stronger. But things are changing in Mexico, and it's time to stop sitting around and get what's ours."
 cartel_politics_sin:9 "§OThe New Dynasty§!"
 cartel_politics_sin_desc:9 "Succession is a complicated affair in the nigh-immortal hierarchy of the cartel. The near-total ghoul membership has meant that a change in leadership rarely goes smoothly, and for decades now Maria ruled as regent before officially taking the top job. But now things have changed, Emilia Sinaloa, A smoothskin cartel teniente and the goddaughter of Sinaloa, has been declared Maria's official successor, and will take the reigns of the cartel upon Maria's 'retirement.'"
 cartel_politics_blo:9 "§PNo Más Iguales§!"
 cartel_politics_blo_desc:9 "Too much time is wasted on 'divisions' in power, weakening the whole and causing greater strife. Let's solve this issue permanently: there will be no equals to my rule, not from the smoothskins, from Sinaloa, or anyone else."
 cartel_eliminate_yesmen:9 "§OEliminate the Yesmen§!"
 cartel_eliminate_yesmen_desc:9 "Loyalty is a good trait, but ambition is better. Rather than hire the insipidly trustworthy, positions of power will be given to those who strive for it."
 cartel_reaffirm_ties:9 "Reaffirm Ties"
 cartel_reaffirm_ties_desc:9 "While our relations have been somewhat shaky in the past, the cartels must stand together if they are to prosper. Restablishing our special relationship will provide a deterrant to any over-eager expansion by our neighbours for the time being."
 cartel_the_northern_bloodbath:9 "§PLa Masacre del Norte§!"
 cartel_the_northern_bloodbath_desc:9 "The northern plains have long resisted cartel overlordship, and to this day remain a thorn in our side. If these upstart smoothskins will not serve us as subjects, their corpses will serve as fertilizer."
 cartel_las_granjas_racket:9 "§OLas Granjas Racket§!"
 cartel_las_granjas_racket_desc:9 "The Las Granjas leadership is notoriously corrupt to the point of farce. While we've mostly ignored the dirpoor ranchers in past, perhaps a largescale bribery operation would be profitable, as long as they don't pay in brahmin."
 cartel_burn_the_forum:9 "§PQuemando el Foro§!"
 cartel_burn_the_forum_desc:9 "The traders of the Viceroyalty are easy pickings, grown fat on their wealthy trade barges, and overconfident due to Tlaloc's guarantee. Let's teach these overblown streetvendors the new lesson: No Más Iguales."
 cartel_navojoa_infiltration:9 "§ONavojoa Contacts§!"
 cartel_navojoa_infiltration_desc:9 "The loss of Navojoa was costly, but our presence in the province hasn't completely disappeared. There are more than a few corrupt officials and traders who chafe against the new ownership, and it's possible we can use the luchadore obsession with 'freedom' against them."
 cartel_the_paz_conference:9 "The Gulf Conference"
 cartel_the_paz_conference_desc:9 "Bandidos, Dictators, and Capos. Our aspirations and our methods are vastly different, but our common enemies have united us together both economically and militarily. It's time for us to formalise this alliance properly, and plan the future of a new era for the Gulf."
 cartel_the_raid:9 "§PLa Gran Incursión§!"
 cartel_the_raid_desc:9 "The Free Fighters make a big show of their 'protection' of the wasteland peasants, but in reality their control is only strongly felt in the urban areas. A coordinated terror strike on the southern badlands will remind whatever smoothskins that survive who REALLY controls the wastes."
 cartel_the_benefactor:9 "The Benefactor"
 cartel_the_benefactor_desc:9 "El Generalissimo is a generous patron, as long as his interests align with yours. Luckily, he's just as keen to remove the luchadores from Mexico as we are, and will glady provide the means to do so, for a very reasonable price."
 cartel_cut_the_supplylines:9 "Cut the Lines"
 cartel_cut_the_supplylines_desc:9 "Rio remains an unknown factor in our plans for conquest. It's unlikely, but still possible that they might come to the aid of the Free Fighters, which would be a disaster for our stretched forces. While we can't harm Rio directly, we can damage their trade with the luchadores, in the hope that it will disincentivise them to interfere."
 cartel_meet_me_in_the_middle:9 "Meet Me in the Middle"
 cartel_meet_me_in_the_middle_desc:9 "It's time for round two, motherfucker."
 cartel_army:9 "Arm the Sicarios"
 cartel_army_desc:9 "The majority of our militia troops are little more than thugs, suitable only for terrorizing the infirm and elderly. In contrast, our cartel enforcers are well trained, and effective killers, and utilizing them as shock infantry will bolster our army strength."
 cartel_fire_and_fury:9 "Fire and Fury"
 cartel_fire_and_fury_desc:9 "Attempting to instill military training to armed criminals is a waste of time when their own violent instincts serve them just as effectively. Promoting a spirit of brutality in our forces will help this bloodthirsty nature shine."
 cartel_quiet_violence:9 "Quiet Violence"
 cartel_quiet_violence_desc:9 "Professionalism in battle is both an art and a science. The knowledge not only of how to kill, but when, where, and why is a skill that produces a true warrior where before there was simply a killer. "
 cartel_stoking_the_flame:9 "Stoking the Flame"
 cartel_stoking_the_flame_desc:9 "A murderer is simply a soldier out of uniform. Those who have already demonstrated a penchant for taking life are to have their talents utilized to our discretion rather than punished."
 cartel_squad_tactics:9 "Squad Tactics"
 cartel_squad_tactics_desc:9 "Rather than organise our troops into large battalions, a focus on smaller, close-knit squads is needed. Capable of performing duties both in pitched battle and in individual missions, these squads will be a welcome supliment to our domestic and international operations."
 cartel_fear_and_hatred:9 "Fear and Loathing and Hatred"
 cartel_fear_and_hatred_desc:9 "Anger is a powerful motivator, but requires a fire inside the spirit that must be coaxed awake. It matters not who our troops hate, so long as they channel that fury towards our enemies."
 cartel_payment:9 "Armaments of Avarice"
 cartel_payment_desc:9 "Pipe weapons are for two-bit gangsters and braindead raiders. Our cartel troops will have the finest in Mexican weaponry, as befitting an organisation of our elevated calibre."
 cartel_the_arms_race:9 "The New Arms Race"
 cartel_the_arms_race_desc:9 "While the majority of our arms come from Gente stock, fortune favours the prepared. Our own munitions factories will supplement our imports and provide a failsafe in the event that the Generalissimo finally loses his marbles."
 cartel_military_hierarchy:9 "Ghoul Hierarchy"
 cartel_military_hierarchy_desc:9 "Ghouls aren't the best for frontline combat, but their years of experience and reliability make them the perfect commanding officers. Some might call this discrimination, and they'd probably be right."
 cartel_a_better_class_of_villain:9 "A Better Class of Villain"
 cartel_a_better_class_of_villain_desc:9 "There are many reasons to fight in the Wasteland. Honour, Glory, Power, to name a few. But these reasons all have the same flaw: You can't buy a mansion with honour and glory. The pursuit of profit is the most logical, and noble reason to fight, and we stand to make a killing."
 cartel_air_theory:9 "Airborne Theory"
 cartel_air_theory_desc:9 "Planes are no longer the go-to method for drug running, mainly due to how conspicuous they are. But as a supplementary to our ground forces, It's possible that the shock and awe factor alone is worth the cost of further development."
 cartel_heavy_reinforcements:9 "Heavy Support"
 cartel_heavy_reinforcements_desc:9 "Any strategy that puts an inch of steel between me and enemy fire is a strategy I support."
 cartel_technology:9 "Stop the Brain Drain"
 cartel_technology_desc:9 "The longer we let the exodus of our lands continue, the sooner we will be bereft of all but the most pitiful of subjects. Providing at least some incentive to the worthwhile smoothskins in our community will help halt this mass departure."
 cartel_scientific_procurement:9 "Scientific 'Procurement'"
 cartel_scientific_procurement_desc:9 "It's sad to say, but our scientific community was already pitiful before everyone started leaving, and by now the damage is pretty much done. To make up for lost time, we can instead 'procure' cutting edge research and researchers from our more technologically advanced neighbours."
 cartel_tech_mil:9 "Military Engineers"
 cartel_tech_mil_desc:9 "While it seems deceptively easy, the art of digging ditches, stripping rifles, and filling mass graves is an important and scarce skill. Best that we get these basics down-pat before moving on to more complex processes of war."
 cartel_tech_base:9 "Duplicated Research"
 cartel_tech_base_desc:9 "Our fellow cartel members have recently begun to develop their own science base. Sharing our knowledge with them and vice versa will help us gain the edge on our more technologically advanced rivals."
 cartel_tech_industry:9 "Civil Architects"
 cartel_tech_industry_desc:9 "Mass production is still a ways off from being achivable, but we've already rediscovered new building and production methods to be more efficient than our current means. Applying these new methods across our nation will help streamline our production and further increase efficiency."
 cartel_tech_specialisation:9 "Drug Expertise"
 cartel_tech_specialisation_desc:9 "When it comes to the application and cultivation of narcotics, nobody is our equal north of Mexico City. Applying this proficency to more benign drugs will be useful in our burgeoning smoothskin health sector."
 cartel_tech_industry2:9 "Economic-Manufacturing Integration"
 cartel_tech_industry2_desc:9 "With both our economy and industry revitalised, it's time to synchronize these two fields and interconnect them as a proper command economy."

  ###EVENTS###
 nf_cartel.1.t:9 "Since 1989..."
 nf_cartel.1.d:9 "With the withdrawal of U.S. occupation forces and the extinction of the Mexican government, the criminal syndicates of North Mexico were the only armed and organised group still functional in the fallout of the Great war. Consolidating under the Sinaloa branch, the cartels would impose a rough and bloody order in the surrounding regions in the aftermath of the apocalypse, with the vast majority of their original members succumbing to radiation poisoning and becoming 'morbosos,' or ghouls. Over time, the cartel would expand and reform, eventually taking direct control of the Sinaloa region, but they'd always retain one ethos of their pre-war heritage. "
 nf_cartel.1.a:9 "'Loyalty is Everything'"
 nf_cartel.1.b:9 "'Money is Power'"

 nf_cartel.2.t:9 "The Narco-Queen of Sinaloa"
 nf_cartel.2.d:9 "As the cartel grew and asserted itself, the matter of leadership soon became a crisis. With many of the upper ranks of pre-war capos already ghoulified, leadership soon began to stagnate, and unrest began to build in the lower ranks. Maria Sinaloa entered this conflict as a young teniente, already moriboso but also part of the new generation of first generation wasteland-born narcos seeking to challenge the decrepit leadership. Maria would play these two groups off each other, and when the conflict escalated into full-scale civil war, she sold out the new blood, integrating her clique into the hierarchy before brutally purging the upper ranks, emerging as the uncontested ruler of the cartel. As Maria began her centuries-long reign as the undisputed ruler of Sinaloa, she faced her first choice, what fate awaited the defeated new bloods and dissident old guards in her regime?"
 nf_cartel.2.a:9 "She sent them south, and let the past lie."
 nf_cartel.2.b:9 "She tied off loose ends."

 nf_cartel.3.t:9 "El Renacimeiento"
 nf_cartel.3.d:9 "The explosive Luchadore uprising tore the cartel in two. While the traditional heartland of the syndicate was in the north, the southern territories were a backwater even by criminal standards. When effective control by Sinaloa was severed, the ghouls adopted the Beltran-Leyva title, reviving the legacy of the long-dead cartel. A shortage of peasantry to rob and competition with Aztlan had left the region barren, and the now independant narcos had to make a tough choice on what to prioritize in their newly-isolated lands."
 nf_cartel.3.a:9 "They focused on exploitation."
 nf_cartel.3.b:9 "They focused on security and defense."

 nf_cartel.4.t:9 "Sangre y Balas"
 nf_cartel.4.d:9 "While the ghouls regrouped, the Luchadores continued their revolution. With the conflict stalling in the north, the wrestlers turned their eyes southwards. Soon, uprisings were occuring in Beltran territory, and it looked like the newborn cartel was not long for this world. In this hour of crisis, a lone ghoul stepped into the spotlight. Nobody knew where they came from, and they spoke espanol with a thick, rasping accent, but they lead a pack of thugs and murderers as vicious as any cartel outfit. As the bandit's crew struck back against the freedom fighters, a legend of cruelty and bloodthirstiness was born. The bandit took no prisoners, accepted no surrender, and fought like a demon. By the time the tide turned and the luchadores were driven back to their lands, The Bloody Bandit had become de-facto leader of the cartels forces, and rather than face another civil war, the tenientes pledged their allegiance to the new tyrant of Mexico."
 nf_cartel.4.a:0 "Salutations au Roi"

 nf_cartel.5.t:9 "Two Cartels alike in Infamy..."
 nf_cartel.5.d:9 "In a way, the luchadore revolt was inevitable; decades of mistreatment, neglect, and envious looks at the freedom of their neighbours boiled into a fullscale liberation war in the cartel lands. In another sense, the fact that this uprising was headed by a trio of masked goons obsessed with wrestling was pretty much impossible to fathom. The cartel was shaken, torn asunder, but still fighting, and now with the dust settling, they are ready to once again reassert themselves both as the masters of Sinaloa, but as criminal kingpins of the wasteland. "
 nf_cartel.5.a:9 "Through courage we will prevail!"
 nf_cartel.5.b:9 "Through cunning we will prevail!"

 nf_cartel.6.t:9 "23rd Century Innovation"
 nf_cartel.6.d:9 "Our accumulated efforts to redesign, appropriate, and outright steal the technology of the wasteland has given us a technological catchup to the 23rd century. But if we are to go further, we need to decide what to focus our own domestic research on."
 nf_cartel.6.a:9 "Let's get Lasers!"
 nf_cartel.6.b:9 "We need to support our infantry detachments."
 nf_cartel.6.b:9 "A better grasp of industry is paramount."

 nf_cartel.7.t:9 "Cartel Barges on the Fuerte!"
 nf_cartel.7.d:9 "The expulsion of the cartels from the Fuerte river was a major achievement of our original uprising against their tyranny. Now however, with a recent surge in naval production, they have returned. While the barges that now navigate the Fuerte have yet to offer any provocation to our own vessels, their presence is unwelcome, and signals a growing boldness in narco activity."
 nf_cartel.7.a:9 "It's not worth troubling ourselves over."
 nf_cartel.7.b:9 "They wanna rumble? Let's rumble!"

 nf_cartel.8.t:9 "Increasing Cartel Presence in Rio"
 nf_cartel.8.d:9 "Rio's underbelly has had a long history with the Mexican cartels, and while their seedier activities are reprehensible, they are one of the few nations that we can rely on for business. Recently, cartel messengers have approached us, seeking a 'sanctioned' ramp up in business inside Rio's borders. While offering business to these ghouls would be morally bankrupt, it might be a good idea to have them operate where we can see them, as it's unlikely we can stamp out their activities entirely."
 nf_cartel.8.a:9 "Let's keep our enemies close."
 nf_cartel.8.b:9 "Get those ghouls out!"

 nf_cartel.9.t:9 "The Spoils of Crime"
 nf_cartel.9.d:9 "Las Granjas was a corrupt, shameless kleptocracy before we entered the picture, but there's no question that we've definitely accelerated the decline. As it stands, we are in a prime position to massively increase our influence in the region, but it may be more prudent to take our earnings and bolt before the situation collapses entirely."
 nf_cartel.9.a:9 "Set up a long-term operation."
 nf_cartel.9.b:9 "Let's not get too comfortable."
 nf_cartel.9.c:9 "Cash out!"

 nf_cartel.10.t:9 "El Foro Burns!"
 nf_cartel.10.d:9 "With the majority of our naval defense concentrated on our southern border with Aztlan, our presence on the __ river has woefully diminished. The danger of this weakness has now been fully realised, as cartel barges from Beltran crossed the river and ransacked the sleeping Forum, overturning, pillaging, and burning the merchant warehouses, before returning north. All our efforts are currently focused on containing the damages of the blaze, we will never forget the ones who struck against our wealth and peace."
 nf_cartel.10.a:9 "oh the humanity..."

 nf_cartel.11.t:9 "Fuerte Chaos!"
 nf_cartel.11.d:9 "Our worst fears have been proven true. Overnight, the cartel presence on the fuerte river went from peaceful passage to outright blockade. Our people in Navojoa have been completely cut off, and already refugees are trying to cross the river en masse where the cartel presence is smallest. Unfortunately, our own fleets have been caught flat-footed, and we cannot break the blockade without risking a full-blown war.  "
 nf_cartel.11.a:9 "How could this happen!?"

 nf_cartel.12.t:9 "An Invitation to the Gulf Conference"
 nf_cartel.12.d:9 "Our relations with the cartels have been historically cordial, if distant. With tensions on the west coast rising, however, this relationship might prove to be the grounds for a new alliance. As a fellow rogue state, we have been invited to a grand meeting of leaders in the gulf, hosted by the twin cartels. While discussions on trade and industry will take place, the main focus will be on a joint military pact between our nations, and the solidification of the current regimes."

 nf_cartel.13.t:9 "The Gulf Conference: Start"
 nf_cartel.13.d:9 "Fanfare and festivities greeted the beginning of the Gulf Conference, as the the envoys from the Baja, Sinaloa, and Gente met.

 nf_cartel.14.d:9 "While not the main goal of the conference, the meeting of the major powers of the gulf has allowed for a unique  economic opportunity.

While this means the end for our brothers as a criminal outfit, the new pro-cartel attitude in the region allows for us to step in to fill this new ecological-criminal gap."
 nf_cartel.25.a:9 "Ain't that something."

 nf_cartel.26.t:9 "Cartel Arms in Rio"
 nf_cartel.26.d:9 "While we do not have the industry of the T.A.A. or the stockpiles of Gente, through sheer cutthroat determination we've managed to establish cartels arms as an affordable, semi-reliable competitor in the weapons market. Perhaps in recognition of this achievement, the Republic of the Rio Grande has approached us to acquire a new weapons deal, to replace their severed relationship with Texas. While their terms are more than fair, theres no way of knowing whether or not the pipe guns we produce today will be pointed at us tomorrow."
 nf_cartel.26.a:9 "A good deal."
 nf_cartel.26.b:9 "Cartels? No cartels here!"

 nf_cartel.27.t:9 "The Blue Exorcism"
 nf_cartel.27.d:9 "With the destruction of the Free Fighters, the fate of the last Mascara must be decided. While El Santo and Mil Mascaras fought back to back to the last, the luchadore known as the Blue Demon was nowhere to be seen. Now, weeks after their demise, our trackers have brought in the cowardly luchadore, who, faced with the threat of execution, has offered his fealty to the victorious cartels in exchange for his life."
 nf_cartel.27.a:9 "Everyone has a price."
 nf_cartel.27.b:9 "No loose ends."

 nf_cartel.28.t:9 "Bandidos in the Badlands!"
 nf_cartel.28.d:9 "Under the cover of nightful, cartel bandits have snuck over the border of our eastern territories. While this was originally thought to be a small-scale breach, this was in fact part of a larger operation, leading the way for a small army of narcos to cross the badlands and assault our isolated settlements. While this region has little strategic value, this attack has dealt a severe blow to the sense of security in our people, and small pockets of cartel thugs remain at large in our lands."
 nf_cartel.28.a:9 "They'll pay for this..."

 nf_cartel.29.t:9 "The Cartels Close In!"
 nf_cartel.29.d:9 "Reports have reached the city of major attacks by the cartels on our trading caravans to Rio. Our trade with the eastern state was not particularly large, but it represented a vital lifeline and a possible ally from our encroaching foes. Now, with our people cut off from the Republic, it is unlikely that any support will arrive."
 nf_cartel.29.a:9 "Good, that makes it a fair fight!"

 nf_cartel.30.t:9 "The New Neighbours"
 nf_cartel.30.d:9 "Reunions are always a touching affair. Pushing against the luchadores on both sides, the two cartel forces finally made contact in the aftermath of their long-overdue victory. While reports of scattered altercations have arisen, the two sides have remained amicable, and their respective leaders met as fellow victors in the captured city of Los Mochis."
 nf_cartel.30.a:9 "'[ROOT.GetLeader] I Presume?'"

 nf_cartel.31.t:9 "One Last Bout"
 nf_cartel.31.d:9 "To our surprise, the irradiated brute known as Mil Mascaras did not die in the siege of Los Mochis, despite suffering wounds that would of killed a normal man or ghoul thrice over. The bullfighter now sits in a bullpen, the object of mockery and ridicule by his once sworn enemies, but a life in captivity would not be a fitting end for such a legendary specimen, and it pays to tie up these loose ends, what finale will we give the green giant?"
 nf_cartel.31.a:9 "Bring out the radscorpions!"
 nf_cartel.31.b:9 "Something more exciting, a pair of Dust-Devils!"
 nf_cartel.31.c:9 "Let's Raise the stakes: bring me a Deathclaw!"

 nf_cartel.32.t:9 "One Last Bout: A Fitting End"
 nf_cartel.32.d:9 "Mil Mascaras has met an end fitting to his life: in front of a braying crowd, against insurmountable odds, in an ultimately pointless show of machismo. As aides dragged giant carcass to be dumped in an unmarked grave, the last vestige of the luchadore uprising has been purged from our lands."
 nf_cartel.32.a:9 "Good riddance."

 nf_cartel.33.t:9 "One Last Bout: An Unlikely Upset"
 nf_cartel.33.d:9 "Against all odds, the green giant managed to defeat his last foes. standing upon the animal carcass, he roared his defiance to the booing crowd, alongside multiple obscene phrases and gestures. Luckily, a firing squad was on standby to cull the bastard, but it did put a damper on what was meant to be a fun and lighthearted show."
 nf_cartel.33.a:9 "Well that's a bit awkward."

 nf_cartel.34.t:9 "From Our Syndicate to Yours"
 nf_cartel.34.d:9 "What do you give someone who has everything? As the undisputed rulers of Sinaloa, it's a hard task to find something that'd spark the interest of the cartel. Already enured to a panoply of luxurious narcotics, and mostly disinterested in carnal pleasures due to skincare-related chafing, there's little that a druglord wants that they don't already have. Still, it's the thought that counts. "
 nf_cartel.34.a:9 "Perhaps the Bandit could use some English lessons?"
 nf_cartel.34.b:9 "Nothing shows you care like a firearm."
 nf_cartel.34.c:9 "Perhaps the Queen could be 'reunited' with an old friend."
 nf_cartel.34.d:9 "It needs to be something from the heart!"

 nf_cartel.35.t:9 "A Celebration!"
 nf_cartel.35.d:9 "Life in the cartel need not be a constant array of backstabbing and subterfuge. Sometimes, a ghoul simply wants to enjoy life, whether it be a packed beachside fiesta in the gulf sun, or a quiet night together at the Midnight Theatre. The pleasure of life is in variety, after all."
 nf_cartel.35.a:9 "Fiesta!"
 nf_cartel.35.b:9 "Why don't we go somewhere special?"

 nf_cartel.36.t:9 "Blues and Dreams"
 nf_cartel.36.d:9 "Despite their shared status and rule, in many ways the Queen and the Bandit come from worlds apart. One is the last vestige of old-world crime. A 300 year scion of the world's underbelly. The other is a product of the apocalypse, living and knowing only the wasteland set before them. And yet, fate, ambition, and incredible violence have drawn the two together, to shape the fabric of the new world they rule."
 nf_cartel.36.a:9 "The Old World Blues are better together."
 nf_cartel.36.b:9 "New World Dreams can be reality."

 nf_cartel.37.t:9 "The Gift of Closure"
 nf_cartel.37.d:9 "During Maria Sinaloa's 'housecleaning' of the Sinaloa old guard, one notable teniente managed to elude her grasp. Gabriel Torrez was a high-ranking narco and former leader of the Cartel forces who had seen the writing on the wall during Maria's rise early, and had fled to the southlands rather than face the queen's judgement. After the uprising and subsequent creation of Beltran, Torrez swore his loyalty to the new cartel regime, in hope that it would afford a level of protection from Northern Sinaloa's reach. Unfortunately for Torrez, his extradition to Maria has served as a perfect housewarming gift from the bandit, a gesture both of goodwill and a symbol of Beltran's loyalty to Maria's clique. "
 nf_cartel.37.a:9 "Another loose end tied off."
 nf_cartel.37.b:9 "How thoughtful."

 nf_cartel.38.t:9 "The Gift of Family"
 nf_cartel.38.d:9 "Emilia has returned to Sinaloa after an extended tour of the Beltran territories, where she was treated to the finest extravagances and luxuries the southern syndicate could offer. While it was primarily a holiday, Emilia acquitted herself well in the various intrigues of the southern clique, as well as providing various assurances and messages from Sinaloa proper. She returns as a wiser ruler-to-be, with the most prized gift being a hand-engraved revolver, a souvenir from a personal week of shooting lessons with the bandit himself."
 nf_cartel.38.a:9 "Did you bring back any vacation photos?"
 nf_cartel.38.b:9 "Let's hope she puts in a good word."

 nf_cartel.380.t:9 "A Gift from the Old World"
 nf_cartel.380.d:9 "Nostalgia is a powerful, and dangerous, thing. In the final days of the old Sinaloa Cartel, its leadership became decripit and moribund, focused on past glories and cherishing the trappings of the past world rather than seeing the world around them. Amongst these artifacts was a special symbol, aand deadly ancient blade, said to be carried by the legendary 'El Capo' of the pre-war Sinaloa cartel. Maria had no use for such vanities, and left them to collect dust in some forgotten cellar. But perhaps, such a symbol has a use after all, both to demonstrate the shared roots of our cartel, and to appeal to the Bandido's love of personal violence."
 nf_cartel.380.a:9 "Make sure to wrap it carefully."
 nf_cartel.380.b:9 "A heartwarming gift."

 nf_cartel.39.t:9 "'Is love a tender thing?'"
 nf_cartel.39.d:9 "Many relationships in the wasteland are borne out of necessity, advantage, or cruelty, for there is little love to be found in the violent, despairing world of the wasteland. As the bandit and the queen stood alone in the ruins of Los Mochis, it's hard to say if there was love in the pitted hand outstretched, or in the shallow kiss that graced it. Perhaps it was a little less than a romance, and a little more than a friendship, but love is hard to find in the wasteland, so perhaps it should be taken in the forms it can be found..."
 nf_cartel.39.a:9 "In a rough poem, a bowed head, and a twitching, scarred smile."
 nf_cartel.39.b:9 "In a sealed note, a smirk on burnt lips, and the faintest of nods."

 nf_cartel.40.t:9 "'Our Dancing Day'"
 nf_cartel.40.d:9 "It's a rare occasion indeed that draws the whole of Mexico together. Half business merger, half wedding, the reunion of the two cartels drew well-wishers across the lands: Phantasma and Colibri capos, Badland captains and dignitaries from Rio and the Aztlan (only unofficially, of course), with a rare appearance of the Baron himself. The Generalissimo arrived late, but made up for it with generous gifts of libations and entertainments, winning himself a spot as the life of the party. At the heart of the celebration was the table of honour, where the two drug lords affirmed the joining of the two cartels into one nation, as long as crime shall live, for rich and for richer."
 nf_cartel.40.a:9 "To the happy couple!"
 nf_cartel.40.b:9 "'In business and in pleasure.'"
 nf_cartel.40.c:9 "'Mi amor por dios y por ti.'"
 nf_cartel.40.e:9 "I'm honestly not sure how to feel about this..."

 nf_cartel.41.t:9 "The Only Game in Town"
 nf_cartel.41.d:9 "For the past few decades, the Sinaloa cartels have had to play second fiddle to the whims of the Generalissimo. Non-compete clauses, guaranteed markets, and the exclusion of Gente del Sol from cartel operations are but a few of the indignities this unequal relationship foistered upon us. However, with the Luchadore threat defeated and the cartels united once more, an opportunity has arisen for us to rectify this situation. While we could use our newfound strength to build a mutual alliance with Gente, the option also exists for us to finally spread our influence in Gente, whether that be by infiltration, or more forceful methods."
 nf_cartel.41.a:9 "We'll approach them as equals."
 nf_cartel.41.b:9 "Let's set up shop."
 nf_cartel.41.c:9 "What's theirs is ours."

 nf_cartel.42.t:9 "The Cartels seek a Military Alliance"
 nf_cartel.42.d:9 "Following their recent victory over the Free Fighters and the stabilisation of the region, the [FROM.GetName] Cartel has now approached us offering a full military alliance. The cartels are our natural allies and a steady source of business, but accepting the alliance would mean taking second-position to the whims of the cartels."
 nf_cartel.42.a:9 "Let us be friends and allies!"
 nf_cartel.42.b:9 "We can surely do better than ghoul gangsters."

 nf_cartel.43.t:9 "Gente Accepts!"
 nf_cartel.43.d:9 "Our envoy to Gente del Sol has returned with wonderful news: Gente has accepted our offer of alliance!"
 nf_cartel.43.a:9 "A Toast to the Generalissimo!"

 nf_cartel.44.t:9 "Gente Refuses!"
 nf_cartel.44.d:9 "Our envoy to Gente del Sol has returned with disappointing news: Gente has refused to join any alliance under our leadership."
 nf_cartel.45.a:9 "What a shame."

 nf_cartel.45.t:9 "Dealing with the Devil"
 nf_cartel.45.d:9 "The cartel influence in our nation has become a bit of an unwelcome, yet common phenomenon. However, it cannot be denied that their presence has provided opportunities for a not-insignificant profit. Perhaps seeking to capitalise on this, the Cartels have approached us directly, offering attractive market opportunities, military support, and the reduction of 'unpleasant' operations, in return for a pact of friendship and guarantee of protection and non-interference in cartel activities. Accepting this deal would mean effectively giving them free reign in our nation, but the reward would be a tidy profit."
 nf_cartel.45.a:9 "Their offer is acceptable."
 nf_cartel.45.b:9 "We don't deal with criminal lowlifes."
 nf_cartel.45.c:9 "Why stop there, invite them to a full alliance!"

 nf_cartel.46.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepte !"
 nf_cartel.46.d:9 "In a surprising turn of events [FROM.GetName] has accepted our offer, allowing us an unprecedented level of access to their nation. While this may backfire on us horribly in the event of a future war, for now we are in the money!"
 nf_cartel.46.a:0 "Excellent."

 nf_cartel.47.t:9 "[FROM.GetName] Declines..."
 nf_cartel.47.d:9 "Perhaps unsurprisingly, [FROM.GetName] has rejected our reasonable offer of mutual guarantees and assistance. This will be a major setback to our international aims."
 nf_cartel.47.a:9 "It was worth a try."

 nf_cartel.48.t:9 "[FROM.GetName] Offers an Alliance!"
 nf_cartel.48.d:9 "In a VERY unexpected turn of events, [FROM.GetName] have returned our offer of mutual gaurantees and assistance with a counter-offer: a fully-fledged membership in their alliance. While this is a very generous offer, it may also be our undoing if the tide of war turns against them in the future."
 nf_cartel.48.a:9 "Sounds good to us!"
 nf_cartel.48.b:9 "Let's stay playful together."

 operation_cartel_navojoa_desc:9 "The loss of Navojoa was costly, but our presence in the province hasn't completely disappeared. There are more than a few corrupt officials and traders who chafe against the new ownership, and it's possible we can use the luchadore obsession with 'freedom' against them."
 operation_cartel_raid:9 "The Raid"
 operation_cartel_raid_desc:9 "The Free Fighters make a big show of their 'protection' of the wasteland peasants, but in reality their control is only strongly felt in the urban areas.

 operation_cartel_bribery:9 "Local Bribery"
 operation_cartel_bribery_desc:9 "While we exert some level of nation-wide influence, our foreign operations are first and foremost local, state-based affairs.

 operation_cartel_factory:9 "Industrial Relocation"
